		<b>The "Morph" transition only works with browsers that natively support view transition API.</b

	</p>
	<p>
		This page has several links to the next page. We want each <a
			transition:name="a11"
			href={otherPage}>link</a
		> to morph into the heading of the target page. The morph effect changes an element in size, position
		and opacity to blend with an element with same transition name on the new page. Intuitively we would
		add <code>transition:name="xyz"</code> to all links and to the heading. But this would not work:
		View transition names must be unique on a page.

	<p>Continue to the <a transition:name="a12" href={otherPage}>next page</a>.</p>
