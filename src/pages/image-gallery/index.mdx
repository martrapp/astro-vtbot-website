This gallery uses the [`<AutoNameSelected />` component](/library/AutoNameSelected/) to give all images a unique `view-transition-name` that will also shows up on the next page.

The names are assigned in random order. This forces the tiles to move to match their position on the next page. These movements are standard [morph transitions](/jotter/api/#morph-animations) which might not only slowly change position but also the size of the tiles.
