			<p>
				Have you often wondered if the app has noticed the click in apps that use view transitions?
				Or have you ever been annoyed and clicked on a link several times because nothing seemed to
				happen?
			</p><p>
				Then you need an indicator that gives you <mark
					>visual feedback that the app has responded</mark
				>: The loading indicator!
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Base functionality and default behavior released.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>

			href="/library/ReplacementSwap/"
			title="ReplacementSwap"
			icon="↹"
			iconStyle="color: darkorange"
			what="Feature / ~0.5k Brotli bytes"
			name="replswap"
		>
			<p>
				The <code>ReplacementSwap</code> component changes how the new page replaces the DOM of the old
				page during view transitions. It <mark>only replaces</mark> the parts that are <mark
					>marked for replacement</mark
				>. Hence the name.
			</p><p>
				It allows you to keep headers and footers including their event listeners and only change
				the main area of your page. It can also solve the problem that view transitions lose the
				content of <i>persisted</i> iframes and the state of animations on transitions.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Reliable and ready to use.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Find and resolve potential bugs.</li>
			</ul>

		<Card
			href="/library/PageOffset/"
			title="Page Offset"
			icon="📄⇞"
			what="Utility / ~0.1k Brotli bytes"
			name="poffset"

			<p>
				This component <mark>removes the pseudo-scrolling</mark> effect introduced by <mark
					>morph animations</mark
				> of elements that are larger than the viewport.
			</p><p>
				Get a smooth, worry free transition that looks great even on large, scrolled down pages.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Used in the Jotter to steady page changes.</p>

		<Card
			href="/library/AutoNameSelected/"
			title="Automatically Name Elements"
			icon="📛"
			what="Utility / ~0.3k Brotli bytes"
			name="ans"
		>
			<p>
				The <code>AutoNameSelected</code> component allows you to <mark
					>automatically assign <code>view-transition-name</code> properties</mark
				> in a declarative way using CSS selectors.
			</p><p>
				Name all your headings or images <mark>to add automatic morph effects</mark> to your navigation.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Used in the Jotter to morph headings.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Additional config required?</li>
				<li>Extend with transition classes?</li>
			</ul>
		</Card>

		<Card
			href="/library/Zoom/"
			title="Zoom"
			icon="🔎🔍"
			what="Animation / ~0.1k Brotli bytes"
			name="zoom"
		>
			<p>
				<code>Zoom</code> offers <mark>animation effects</mark> for view transitions. It can be used
				as a replacement for the standard Astro animations <code>fade()</code> and <code
					>slide()</code
				>.
			</p><p>
				Zoom animations can <mark>enlarge</mark> the current transition group <mark>or shrink</mark>
				it to a point. And the zooming can be combined with a fade effect.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Ready to use, see demos.</p>

		<Card
			href="/library/Swing/"
			title="Swing"
			icon="🎷"
			what="Animation / ~0.1k Brotli bytes"
			name="swing"
		>
			<p>
				<code>Swing</code> offers <mark>animation effects</mark> similar to <code>Zoom</code>. The
				effects allow
				<mark>rotations around all axis</mark> in 3D space.
			</p>
			<p>
				The effect can be used as a drop-in replacement for <code>fade()</code> and <code
					>slide()</code
				>
				but also offers extensive parameters for configuration.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3>

			<p>Ready to use, see demos!</p>

			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Show more parametrization in demos</li>
			</ul>
		</Card>

		<Card
			href="/library/Move/"
			title="Move"
			icon="🚟"
			what="Animation / ~0.2k Brotli bytes"
			name="move"
		>
			<p>
				<code>Move</code> is the newest addition to the <mark>animation effects</mark>. It offers a
				wide range of effects. The basic idea is to have two connected edges along which the old
				image is <mark>moved out</mark>
				and another two connected edges along which the new image is <mark>moved in</mark>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The effect can be used as a drop-in replacement for <code>fade()</code> and <code
					>slide()</code
				>
				but also offers extensive parameters for configuration.

			href="/library/NoScroll/"
			title="NoScroll"
			icon="📜"
			what="Utility / ~0.1k Brotli bytes"
			name="noscroll"
		>
			<p>Sometimes you want to opt out of the default scroll behavior of navigation.</p><p></p> Putting
			the <code>&lt;NoScroll&gt;</code> component in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your page <mark
				>prevents scrolling on transitions</mark
			>. The vertical and horizontal scroll <mark>positions just stay where the are</mark>
			before you clicked a link.

			<h3>Status</h3><p>
				Used on several additional demos including image gallery and the animation demos.
			</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Do we need properties for more fine grained control?</li>
			</ul>
		</Card>

		<Card
			href="/library/BorderControl/"
			title="BorderControl"
			icon="🛂"
			what="Utility / ~0.3k Brotli bytes"
			name="border"
		>
			<p>
				This component <mark>forces a full page load</mark> of the target for incoming view transition.
			</p>
			<p>
				This makes it the <mark>perfect sidekick for the <code>ReplacementSwap</code></mark> component.
			</p>
			<p>Never again worry about how to reinitialize the app area for incoming view transitions.</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Used by the Jotter.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Factor out configuration</li>
			</ul>

			icon="🔊"
			what="Audio / ~0.1k Brotli bytes"
			name="swaps"
		>
			<p><del>View</del><u>Audio</u> Transitions!</p>
			<p>
				Listen to the cranking noises from deep inside the machine as the next page is loaded,
				prepared and animated.
			</p>
			<p>Quickly check which audio files you have got to annoy your visitors!</p>
			<p>
				Not the most serious trick from The Bag. But a fun example of what you can do with the API.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Used by the Jotter.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>I haven't the faintest idea!</li>
			</ul>
		</Card>

		<Card
			href="/library/AnimationStyle/"
			title="AnimationStyle"
			icon="✨"
			what="Animation / ~0.1k Brotli bytes"
			name="animstyle"
		>
			<p>
				This is a component that can <mark>generate style sheets</mark> for view transition animations.
				This works for <mark>native</mark> view transitions <mark>and</mark> for Astro's view transition
				<mark>simulation</mark> for browsers that do not support them natively.
			</p><p>
				This component is used together with the functions offered by <code>animation-style.ts</code
				>
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Used as part of the <code>Zoom</code> and <code>Swing</code> components.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Add more utility functions</li>
			</ul>
		</Card>

		<Card
			href="/library/Portal/"
			title="Portal"
			icon="🚪"
			what="Feature / ~0.2k Brotli bytes"
			name="portal"
		>
			<p>
				The <code>Portal</code>
				<mark>forces all navigation through a single intermediate page</mark>. This page can be used
				to show some loading animation. The transition automatically resumes to the target page of
				the transition once that page is loaded.
			</p><p>
				The benefit of a portal page is that the animation effect can be confined on that very page.
				A limitation compared to *pure* view transitions is that persisted elements and transition
				groups from the current page to the target page are only possible if those are also
				supported by the portal page.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Proof of concept.</p>
			<h3>Future direction</h3><ul>
				<li>Add properties for more fine grained control</li>
			</ul>
		</Card>

		<Card
			href="/library/BrakePad/"
			title="BrakePad"
			icon="🦥"
			what="Utility / ~0.2k Brotli bytes"
			name="brakepad"
		>
			<p>
				As a developer, you want to define and control how your website behaves on slow connections.
				The <code>&lt;BrakePad&gt;</code> component gives you control over when and how to <mark
					>simulate slow loading</mark
				>. By default, the brake pad is a <mark>DEV mode only</mark> feature.
			</p><p>
				But you can also switch it active for production if you want to force some delay during view
				transitions. Admittedly, you typically want transitions to be slick and snappy. So this is a
				bit of a niche feature, but it can be very helpful for testing and debugging.
			</p>
			<h3>Status</h3><p>Reliable and ready to use.</p>
