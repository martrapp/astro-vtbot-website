				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>
					Founded in 2020, Modern Design Studio emerged from a simple belief: that great design has
					the power to transform businesses and create meaningful connections between brands and
					their audiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					What started as a small team of passionate designers has grown into a full-service
					creative studio, serving clients across industries and continents. Despite our growth,
					we've maintained our core values of creativity, collaboration, and commitment to
					excellence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our diverse team brings together expertise in visual design, user experience, front-end
					development, and brand strategy. This multidisciplinary approach allows us to tackle
					complex challenges and deliver comprehensive solutions that drive real business results.
