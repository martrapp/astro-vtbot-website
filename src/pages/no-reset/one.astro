			This is a page that features an infinite animation and an iframe. Both sit in an element that
			is annotated with <code>transition:persist="keep"</code>. So they will appear on the next
			page, and their state should be taken over.
		</p><p>
			Enter some search term in the iframe. Wait for the circle to be on the left side of the
			screen. Now click the link at the top of the page to navigate to the next page and watch.
