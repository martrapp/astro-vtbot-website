# Installing astro-vtbot

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-vtbot" target="_blank"><img data-zoom-off style="margin:1ex 0" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/astro-vtbot?style=plastic&logo=npm&label=astro-vtbot&color=rgba(0%2C200%2C200%2C0.5))"/></a>

`astro-vtbot` can be installed as a full [Astro integration](#installing-as-an-astro-integration) or as a [node package](#installing-as-a-node-package). Both ways install the package as a dependency in your project and allow you to import its components and scripts in your own pages. Installing as an integration in addition gives you access to **The Bag's DevToolbar App** with the ability to open the [Inspection Chamber](/library/InspectionChamber/) on any page during dev mode.

If you're unsure, go with installing it as an integration!

## Installing as an Astro integration

Installing `astro-vtbot` as an Astro integration will install the package and it will add the Bag's devToolbar app that lets you open the InspectionChamber on any page during development mode.

To install `astro-vtbot` as an Astro integration, run the `astro add` command in your project directory ...

```bash
npx astro add astro-vtbot
```

... and press the return key trice to answer the questions with "yes":

```bash
⚠ astro-vtbot is not an official Astro package.
✔ Continue? … yes
✔ Resolving with third party packages...

  Astro will run the following command:
  If you skip this step, you can always run it yourself later

 ╭─────────────────────────────────╮
 │ npm install astro-vtbot@^2.0.0  │
 ╰─────────────────────────────────╯

✔ Continue? … yes
✔ Installing dependencies...

  Astro will make the following changes to your config file:

 ╭ astro.config.ts ──────────────────────────────╮
 │ import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';  │
 │                                               │
 │ import vtbot from 'astro-vtbot';              │
 │                                               │
 │ export default defineConfig({                 │
 │   integrations: [vtbot()],                    │
 │ });                                           │
 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✔ Continue? … yes

   success  Added the following integration to your project:
  - astro-vtbot
```

If you have Astro's DevToolbar enabled, The Bag will show up as a new app there and will give you access to the InspectionChamber on every page without any further modification of your project.

### Changes introduced with astro-vtbot 2.0

Installing astro-vtbot as an integration used to add `vtbot`'s [`<LoadingIndicator />` component](../LoadingIndicator/) and [`<Linter />` component](../Linter/) to all pages that use Astro's `<ClientRouter />`. This behavior was changes in 2.0: None of these features will be added automatically anymore.

 You can still get the former behavior by explicitly setting  the `loadingIndicator` option and/or the `autoLint` option of `vtbot` in your `astro.config` file to `true` (the default is now `false`):

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {5}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import vtbot from "astro-vtbot";
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [vtbot({
		loadingIndicator: true, autoLint: true
	})],
});
```
:::note
As of `astro-vtbot 2.0`, the `autoLint` and `loadingIndicator` parameters are **deprecated** and will be completely removed in a future version. To prepare for that change, do not set these parameters to true but include the `<Linter />` and `<LoadingIndicator/>` in your global Layout.astro or on dedicated pages as required.
:::

<style>{`aside{border: 1pt solid #642; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #321; padding: 2ex} .starlight-aside__title{font-size: 1.25rem; padding-left: 30px} aside svg{transform: scale(2) translateX(-10px)}`}</style>

As an alternative to the loadingIndicator, you can also add the [`<ProgressBar />`](/library/LoadingIndicator/#alternative-2-use-the-loadingindicator--or-the-progressbar--component) component to your Layout.astro.


## Installing as a node package

To install `astro-vtbot` as a node package without the integration, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install astro-vtbot
```
