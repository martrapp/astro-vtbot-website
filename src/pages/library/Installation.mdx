# Installing astro-vtbot

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-vtbot" target="_blank"><img data-zoom-off style="margin:1ex 0" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/astro-vtbot?style=plastic&logo=npm&label=astro-vtbot&color=rgba(0%2C200%2C200%2C0.5))"/></a>

`astro-vtbot` can be installed as a full [Astro integration](#installing-as-an-astro-integration) or as a [node package](#installing-as-a-node-package). Both ways install the package as a dependency in your project and allow you to import its components and scripts in your own pages. Installing the package **as an Astro integration** in addition sets up your project with an **automatic loading indicator** and **automatic linter warnings** in the browser console. Installing as an integration also gives you access to **The Bag's DevToolbar App!**

## Installing as an Astro integration

Installing `astro-vtbot` as an Astro integration will install the package and in addition it will by default add `vtbot`'s [`<LoadingIndicator />` component](../LoadingIndicator/) and [`<Linter />` component](../Linter/) to all pages that use Astro's `<ViewTransitions />`. However, there are also options to selectively opt out of either feature, as detailed below.

To install `astro-vtbot` as an Astro integration, run the `astro add` command in your project directory ...

```bash
npx astro add astro-vtbot
```

... and press the return key twice to answer the questions with "yes":

```bash
⚠ astro-vtbot is not an official Astro package. Use at your own risk!
✔ Continue? … yes
✔ Resolving with third party packages...

  Astro will run the following command:
  If you skip this step, you can always run it yourself later

 ╭─────────────────────────────────╮
 │ npm install astro-vtbot@^1.2.0  │
 ╰─────────────────────────────────╯

✔ Continue? … yes
✔ Installing dependencies...
10:26:52
   success  Configuration up-to-date.
```

As a result `astro-vtbot` will hook into your `astro.config` file:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {3,7}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

import vtbot from "astro-vtbot";

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [vtbot()],
});
```

When you start Astro in DEV mode, e.g. `npm run dev`, this will automatically add `vtbot`'s [`<Linter />` component](../Linter/) to all pages that use Astro's `<ViewTransitions />`. This will **only happen in DEV mode**. When you build for production, the `<Linter />` component will not be included.

You can disable automatic linting and the loading-indicator without having to remove the integration by setting the `loadingIndicator` option and/or the `autoLint` option of `vtbot` in your `astro.config` file to `false` (the default is `true`):

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {5}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import vtbot from "astro-vtbot";
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [vtbot({
		loadingIndicator: false, autoLint: false
	})],
});
```

After disabling the loadingIndicator, as an alternative, you could also add the [`<ProgressBar />`](/library/LoadingIndicator/#alternative-2-use-the-loadingindicator--or-the-progressbar--component) component to your Layout.astro.

If you have Astro's DevToolbar enabled, The Bag will show up as a new app there and will give you access to the InspectionChamber on every page without any further modification of your project.

## Installing as a node package

To install `astro-vtbot` as a node package without the integration, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install astro-vtbot
```
