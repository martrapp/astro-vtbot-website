The `<BorderControl />` component turns incoming view transitions into full page loads.

## Contents

## Why should I use this component?
Forcing full page loads comes in handy if a view transition is not able to properly re-initialize the [app state](/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/app-state/) of the target page. This might be the case when are using the [ `<ReplacementSwap>` component](/library/ReplacementSwap/) and have other pages outside the area covered by `ReplacementSwap` and you  have view transitions from there into that `ReplacementSwap` area.

## How Does it Work?
You define URL patterns to tell the component which area is to be protected. You can define the inside or the outside of the fence, whichever is more practical. If a navigation starts outside and goes to page that is not outside of the fence &mdash;
or if a navigation goes to a page inside the fence but does not start inside the fence, the target page is loaded with a full page load. Path name prefixes are used to specify whether a page is _inside_ or _outside_ the protected area.

The full page load resets the browser state of the current tab/window and therefore does a proper (re-)initialization of the page content and all scripts.  This also works for history traversals (browser forward / backward navigation) that can not be annotated with [`data-astro-reload`](/jotter/astro/directives/).

## Usage

[Install astro-vtbot](../Installation/) in your project as an Astro integration with `npx astro add astro-vtbot` or as a node package with `npm install astro-vtbot`.

The recommended way is to place the `<BorderControl />` component in your basic layout after the `<ViewTransitions />` component.

```astro title="MyLayout.astro" {3,8}
---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
import BorderControl from 'astro-vtbot/components/BorderControl.astro';
---
<html>
  <head>
    <ViewTransitions />
    <BorderControl fence={{inside:["/docs/", "/blog/"]}}/>
    ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

### Properties

The component has a mandatory property called `fence`. This is an object with two alternative string arrays. To define the realm that should be protected by the `BorderControl` you can define all the pathname prefixes that are valid for pages `inside` the fence, or you define the pathname prefixes for all pages `outside` the fence. You can choose whichever is more practical but you must only define the inside _or_ the outside.

|   Property | Type | Effect |
|------------|------|--------|
| fence.inside | string[] | An array of path name prefixes that define what is inside the protected area |
| fence.outside | string[] | An array of path name prefixes that define what is outside the protected area|

One of these has to be set but not both.
