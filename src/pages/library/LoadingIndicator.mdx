<h1 style="display: inline-block; view-transition-name: loading-1"><span style="display:inline-block; view-transition-name:loading-2;">‚è≥</span> The Loading Indicator</h1>

The `<LoadingIndicator />` component adds a loading indicator to your view transitions. <a data-astro-reload href="/loading/one/">See it in action</a>

## Contents

## Why should I use this component?

The loading indicator is a great way to let your users know that something is happening. For view transitions, this is even more important than for normal page loads, as the view transition animation only starts after the target page has fully loaded. With a slow internet connection or heavy server-side rendering, this can take quite a while. From the instant the user clicked the link up to the start of the view transition animation the user typically gets no visual feedback. This gap is now filled by the loading indicator.

## How does it work?

The Bag offers very versatile support for loading indicators.
The common feature is to start an action with the click on the link and stop it again when the target page is fully loaded.

To achieve this, `<LoadingIndicator/>` inserts a `loading` class into the html element of the page and removes it later. You can also have it call your Javascript code to show and hide something.

Without any further configuration, the LoadingIndicator component displays a pulsating version of your favicon in the top right corner of the screen during loading.

## Usage

In good Astro tradition this component works out of the box without any configuration. But if you want you can also customize it completely to your needs.

### Alternative 1: Use it as an Astro integration

The easiest way to enjoy the loading indicator is to [install astro-vtbot as an Astro integration](/library/Installation/). This will automatically add the `<LoadingIndicator />` component to all  pages that use the `<ViewTransitions/>` component.

If you want to keep the integration, e.g. for the automatic linter support, but want to (temporarily) disable the loading indicator, set loadingIndicator to false in the configuration:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
integrations: [vtbot({ loadingIndicator: false })]
```

#### Favicon image

You should have a `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.xyz">` in your page `<head>` element. This will be used as the image for the loading indicator. If you do not have a favicon link, `<LoadingIndicator>` will try to load the standard `/favicon.ico`. If that is not there, it will show a grey circle as loading indicator.

`<LoadingIndicator/>` supports various image formats but it works best with raster images with a minimal resolution of 128 x 128 or with `.svg` files. It works not so well  with small `.ico` files.


The image is contained in a `<div>` element which has the id `vtbot-loading-indicator` and you might apply your own styling to it. The generates code will look like this

```html title="your-page.html"
<div id="vtbot-loading-indicator">
	<img src="/favicon.png" alt="Loading indicator" />
</div>
```
or
```html title="your-page.html"
<div id="vtbot-loading-indicator">
	<svg>...</svg>
</div>
```

### Alternative 2: Use the &lt;LoadingIndicator /> component

If you do not install `astro-vtbot` as an Astro integration, or if you set `loadingIndicator` to false in your Astro configuration, you can still install the `<LoadingIndicator />` component directly on your page. The `<LoadingIndicator />` component should be put inside the `<head>` element **behind the `<ViewTransitions/>` component**.


```astro title="YourComponent.astro" {3,8}
---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions'
import LoadingIndicator from 'astro-vtbot/components/LoadingIndicator.astro'
---
<html>
  <head>
    <ViewTransitions />
		<LoadingIndicator />
		...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

Without further configuration, the `<LoadingIndicator />` component will display a pulsating [version of your favicon](#favicon-image) in the top right corner of the screen during loading.

You can configure the source of the image as well as the position. These is the interface:
```astro title="LoadingIndicator.astro"
---
export interface Props {
	top?: string;
	bottom?: string;
	left?: string;
	right?: string;
	src?: string;
}
---
```
The `src` attribute is a href, the position strings are values for the corresponding CSS attributes, e.g.
```astro
<LoadingIndicator bottom="3vh" left="3vh" src="/some/other.png"/>
```
As long as you include the `<LoadingIndicator />` component behind the `<ViewTransitions />` in the `<head>` its attributes will override the defaults of the `<LoadingIndicator />` component that is installed by the Astro integration. So it is ok to have the default via integration on most pages and override it on some pages with an explicit `<LoadingIndicator>` element.

### Styling with CSS
As soon as the user clicks the link, the CSS class `loading` is added to the body element of the page. Once the target page is loaded completely and the view transition is about to begin, the `loading` CSS class is removed again. This allows you to customize the loading indicator via CSS.

The default CSS covers positioning, sizing, and pulsing of the indicator.

```astro title="LoadingIndicator.astro"
<style is:global>
	@layer vtbot {
		@keyframes vtbot-blink {
			0%, 30%  { opacity: 0.0; }
			40%      { opacity: 0.5; }
			50%, 60% { opacity: 0.0; }
			80%      { opacity: 0.3; }
		}
		#vtbot-loading-indicator {
			position: fixed;
			top: 3vh;
			right: 3vw;
			width: min(10vw, 10vh);
			z-index: 1000;
			opacity: 0;
		}
		#vtbot-loading-indicator img {
				width: min(10vw, 10vh);
				height: auto;
			}

		html.loading #vtbot-loading-indicator {
			animation: vtbot-blink 1s infinite;
		}
	}
</style>
```
You can override it with your own styling. Best way to do this is to [define your own custom loading indicator](#publish-or-contribute-your-custom-loading-indicator--pocycli).

> **Trick:** The animation defined above runs a one second cycle over and over. It keeps the loading indicator invisible for the first 30% of the cycle. I.e. for the first 300 ms your indicator does not show. Or in other words: Even though the `.loading` class is added  immediately after the user clicks the link, the indicator will not appear for the first 300 ms. This is a good thing, as it only shows the indicator for slow loading pages and not for a page that is already in the browser cache.

### Use your own #vtbot-loading-indicator

If you want to use your own loading indicator element, you can do so by adding an HTML element with the ID `vtbot-loading-indicator` to your page. In this case the `<LoadingIndicator/>` component does not insert its own loading indicator. Again, best way to do this is to [define your own custom loading indicator](/library/LoadingIndicator/#publish-or-contribute-your-custom-loading-indicator--pocycli).

### Using CSS to define your custom loading indicator

You can define a custom loading indicator by extending the `<LoadingIndicator />` component.
Typically, your component will define an HTML element and styling.
The logic for showing and hiding the loading indicator will be handled by the `<LoadingIndicator />` component.

Here is the template that you also find in the `astro-vtbot` package.
```astro title="components/template/LoadingIndicatorTemplate_CSS.astro" {2,6,10}
---
import LoadingIndicator from 'astro-vtbot/components/LoadingIndicator.astro'
---
{/* By rendering <LoadingIndicator/> here,
		you inherit the logic that sets the "loading" CSS class */}
<LoadingIndicator />

{/* Defining this div is only necessary
		if you do not want to use the default element that holds the favicon image  */}
<div id="vtbot-loading-indicator"> <!-- make sure to use this id -->
  ...
<div>
<style is:global>
	#vtbot-loading-indicator {
	/* basic styling, typically with position: fixed */
	/* hide the indicator with display: none, opacity: 0, visibility: hidden, right: -100vw, ... */
		...
	}
	html.loading #vtbot-loading-indicator {
	/* show the indicator with display: block, opacity: 1, visibility: visible, right: 3vw, ... */
		...
	}
</style>
```
If you are happy with the default loading indicator html you can keep it. Otherwise you define your own, see line 10 above and [the section on alternative elements](#alternative-2-use-the-loadingindicator--component).

### Using JavaScript to define your custom loading indicator

You do not want to craft animations soley with CSS and prefer to use some JavaScript library like
GSAP et.al? No problem. Also in that case you can craft your custom loading indicator. Instead of `<LoadingIndicator/>` component use the `loading-indicator.ts` script.

Here is the template that you also find in the `astro-vtbot` package.

```astro title="components/template/LoadingIndicatorTemplate_JS.astro" {19,20}
---
// Just define javascript or typescript code for hide & show functions
// in the script below.

// You also have to provide the HTML for the loading indicator.
// Include it on your pages, preferable via a common layout
// or - if it is simple - generate it dynamically in the `show` function.

// If you have time consuming setup tasks, you should not run them in `show`.
// It is better to move them to the optional `initializer` function,
// which is executed shortly after a page has been loaded,
// and not when the indicator is already to be displayed

// You can generate the default loading indicator of the back of tricks
// by calling `vtbotLoadingIndicator()`, preferably in the `initializer` function.
---

<script>
	import { loading } from 'astro-vtbot/components/loading-indicator';
	loading(show, hide, initializer);

	function show() {
		// show loading indicator
	}
	function hide() {
		// hide loading indicator
	}

	function initializer() {
		// this function is optional
		// remove the init parameter in the call to loading above if you do not need it
	}
</script>
```
You just define the two functions show and hide and tell the `loading-indicator` about them. In the body of these two functions you can craft your special effects!

### Using custom loading indicators
Your custom loading indicator components can then be used instead of `<LoadingIndicator>`. No need anymore for the `<LoadingIndicator />` component in the `<head>`. Whether your custom component needs to be inserted into the head or the body depends on the *HTML elements* the template section of your component *directly inserts* into the DOM:

- No elements at all? Your component can go either to the `<head>` or to the `<body>`
- `<meta>` or other `<head>` stuff? Your component goes into the `<head>`
- `<div>` or other `<body>` stuff? Your component goes into the `<body>`
- Both? No good idea. Maybe you can generate the body part dynamically?

```astro title="YourPage.astro" {11}
---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions'
import MyCustomLoadingIndicator from './MyCustomLoadingIndicator.astro'
---
<html>
  <head>
    <ViewTransitions />
		...
  </head>
  <body>
    <MyCustomLoadingIndicator />
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

Testing loading indicators is hard with your slick local server. Transitions happen in no time and you can not even get a glimpse of your flashy indicator? You can use your browser's developer tools to simulate a slow network connection!

But you can also put the brakes on, with the [&lt;BrakePad/&gt;](/library/BrakePad/) from the Bag of Tricks.
