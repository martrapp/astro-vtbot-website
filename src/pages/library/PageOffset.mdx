When you put a view transition on the `<body>` or the `<main>` element of your site, you can see a "scrolling" effect on large pages when you initiate the navigation to the next page from the bottom of the long page.

Most authors and users might find this irritating and annoying.

The `<PageOffset />` component completely removes those pseudo-scrolling effects and gives you smooth and neat transitions.

## Contents

## Why should I use this component?

If you have a site with pages that are typically longer than the viewport and you are unhappy with page content sliding through the complete viewport on view transitions.

## How does it work?

The Jotter has a whole section [explaining the problem and the solution](/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/transitions/#the-pseudo-scrolling-main-area).

## Usage

[Install astro-vtbot](../Installation/) in your project as an Astro integration with `npx astro add astro-vtbot` or as a node package with `npm install astro-vtbot`.

The recommended way is to place the `<PageOffset>` component in your basic layout after the `<ViewTransitions />` component.

```astro title="MyLayout.astro" {3,8}
---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
import PageOffset from 'astro-vtbot/components/PageOffset.astro';
---
<html>
  <head>
    <ViewTransitions />
    <PageOffset name="myMain" />
    ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

Be aware that the `<PageOffset />` component
* completely disables the morph animation on the element with the specified name and
* shifts the old image vertically to compensate for the actual change in scroll position that normally occurs when navigating to the next page.

### Properties

The `<PageOffset/>` component has a single mandatory parameter. You have to specify the view transition name of the problematic element that induced the pseudo-scrolling. If you have a view transition named "myName" on your `<main>` element, then use it like in the example above.

Note: It is always a good idea to give transitions an explicit transition name like "myMain", as you can not guess what random name Astro assigns, if you don't. Use the `transition:name="myname"` directive on your `<main>` element if you haven't yet.


|   Property | Type | Effect |
|------------|------|--------|
| name | string | Instructs the `<PageOffset>` component to fix the pseudo scrolling morph animation on the element with the given `view-transition-name`. |

Typically you have at most one such element on your layout. If you need to name multiple elements, repeat the component with different names.
