# Progress Bar: Page One

[Go to page two](../two/)

This page shows a custom progress bar based on an idea by [@kb](https://github.com/k16e-me). It utilizes the [swup progress bar plugin](https://swup.js.org/plugins/progress-plugin/). Click on the **link to page two** a above this section to see it in action.

Install the 👜 Bag of Tricks ✨ in your astro project with **`npm install astro-vtbot`** or [install as an Astro integration!](/library/Installation/). Then use the `<ProgressBar>` like this:
```astro title="UseProgressBar.astro" {3,13,22,23,24}
---
import BrakePad from 'astro-vtbot/components/BrakePad.astro';
import ProgressBar from 'astro-vtbot/components/ProgressBar.astro';
import MdxLayout from './MdxLayout.astro';
---

<MdxLayout {...Astro.props}>
	{
		/* This is the custom component.
		 * It can be put into the <head> or the <body> of your page
		 */
	}
	<ProgressBar />

	{/* To observe the effect in DEV mode it is necessary to simulate 2000ms loading time */}
	<BrakePad duration={2000} />

	<slot />
</MdxLayout>

{/* You can style the progress bar by defining the swup-progress-bar class */}
<style is:global>
	.swup-progress-bar {
		background-color: rgb(64, 128, 192);
	}
</style>
```
The [`<BrakePad />` component](/library/BrakePad/) shown in the listing above is optional. It helps you to see the progress bar even if you have a fast server and a fast connection: It simulates long loading times for DEV mode. `<BrakePad />` does nothing when you build for production.

As an alternative you could also throttle the connection speed using the browser's dev tools.
