<h1>Enabling Forward and Backward Animations with Native Cross-Document View Transitions</h1>

|Demo|Content|
|---|---|
|[Forward Only](/signal-demo/forwardOnly/blog/)|If you simply replace `<ClientRouter />` with `<style>@view-transition{navigation: auto}</style>`, the navigation will only trigger Astro's forward animation.|
|[Back is Back](/signal-demo/multipleDirections/blog/)|Take back control: continue using forward _and_ backward animations of [`transition:animate`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#built-in-animation-directives) or style your directional animations with view transition types!|
|[Page Order](/signal-demo/pageOrder/blog/)|If your site has a concept of _previous_ and _next_ pages, you can derive the animation direction from the order of your pages.|
|[Forced Traversals](/signal-demo/forcedTraversal/blog/)|If you click through a site, pages pile up in your history. How about automatically replacing forward navigation with history traversals for pages seen before?|
|[Same Same!](/signal-demo/same/blog/)|Special styling for links that lead to the current page|
|[Link Types](/signal-demo/link-types/blog/)|Set view transition types per link|
