The <BoT/> offers a colorful bunch of reusable components that support different aspects of view transition enabled sites.  Click on the image to explore the portfolio!


<div style="view-transition-name:bot">[![reusable components](src/assets/components.png)](/components/)</div>

These are generic components that **do not require specific themes**. There are also [Starlight specific components](/jotter/starlight/guide/) in The Bag.
