If you want to know what has changed in the <BoT/>, go [to the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

If you want to know what updates I've made to the Jotter or this website in general, you've come to the right place.

This history starts when the Jotter first leveraged Starlight on 2024-04-01.
The most important changes since the first release relate to the Starlight Guide. The changes are mainly based on user feedback and the fact that I have learned more about things.

|When|What|Where|
|----|-----|----|
|2025-03-14|Updated the conditions for scripts not being executed by the Client Router (reflecting changes in Astro 5.4.2)|[Script Behavior](/jotter/astro/scripts/#behavior-with-view-transitions	)|
|2025-02-15|Starlight 0.32 is there and this brings some updates on the Starlight Guide as 0.32 changes the way parameters to components are handled in Starlight.|[Guide: Starlight with Client Router](/jotter/starlight/guide/)|
|2025-02-15|For those of you who prefer to directly use the View Transition API instead of Astro's `<ClientRouter />`, there is exciting news: `astro-vtbot` now also is a Starlight Plugin that extends Starlight with native view transitions, no client router required!|[StarlightPlugin (no ClientRouter)](/library/StarlightPlugin/)|
|2025-01-09|And the new year starts like the last one ended ;-). More on migration from the `<ClientRouter />` to browser-native cross-document view transitions: A feature comparison so you know what you lose and what you gain. And a migration path with step by step instructions for a possible migration.| [feature comparison](/jotter/feature-comparison/), [migration path](/jotter/migrate/)|
|2024-12-30|Last entry for the year ;-) vtbot gets its first major release. Time to help with the decision between `<ClientRouter />` and native cross-document view transitions.|[Make an informed choice](/jotter/astro-view-transitions/)|
|2024-12-30|Added an entry to the turn-signal demos that features view transition types on a per link basis|[Turn-Signal demos](/signal-demo/)|
|2024-12-14|Just realized, that I never introduced @vtbag as a new Level of The Bag| [Let's extend History!](/jotter/history/#level-4-browser-native-cross-document)
|2024-12-13|Moved this site to Astro 5.0 and Starlight 3.0| no content updates|

|2024-10-09|Added a reference to Bramus's collection of view transition examples|[References](/jotter/api/references/#introduction-by-example)|
|2024-10-04|Another browser-native cross-document view transition aid: The `<CamShaft>` component is what `<PageOffset />` is for `<ViewTransitions />`! Use this component to get rid of unexpected pseudo-scrolling of large view-transition-groups.  |[`<CamShaft/>`](/library/CamShaft/)|
|2024-09-25|For browser-native view transitions: The Turn-Signal component gives  a sense of direction. Now you can continue to use `transition:animate` and have forward and back navigation with native cross-document view transitions!|[`<TurnSignal/>`](/library/TurnSignal/)|
|2024-09-17|Added a new test to the test page: [nested transition groups](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#nested-view-transitions) are coming, but obviously have not arrived, yet|[Visit the test page to check](/jotter/api/test-page/)|
|2024-09-05|A new general purpose component for pure CSS cross-document view transitions: The `<ElementCrossing />` brings some facets of `transition:persist` to `@view-transition{navigation: auto}` |[`<ElementCrossing/>`](/library/ElementCrossing/)|
|2024-08-30|Starlight now retains the sidebar state across navigations, providing a more seamless SPA-like experience without requiring view transitions. The guide has been updated to indicate when it’s still advantageous to add the Bag's view transition support to your Starlight site.|[Breaking News at the top of page](/jotter/starlight/guide/)|
|2024-07-20|v1.8.2 of [`astro-vtbot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-vtbot) is out!
