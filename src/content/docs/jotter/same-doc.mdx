Astro supported cross-document view transitions long before browsers offered native support. And for multi-page sites, like most Astro projects, cross-document transitions make a lot of sense. So it is no surprise Astro became known for them.

But there has been far less buzz about [same-document view transitions](https://vtbag.dev/basics/javascript/#same-document-view-transitions). That is undeserved.

This jotter page focuses on view transitions that happen while staying on the same page. It will also help you avoid the headaches that can come from combining cross-document and same-document transitions in one layout.

**Heads up:** The demos use Astro (this is a Starlight site, after all), but only a [few Astro-specific bits](#astro-specifics) sneak in. The main content stands on its own, no matter what framework you use.

## Why should I care

View transitions can animate _any_ DOM change. And that is not just flair for flair's sake, it can help users understand what your site is doing, reduce cognitive load, or at the very least, keep your site from feeling like it came straight out of the 90s.

Applying a view transition to a DOM change usually takes little effort, and the payoff can be surprisingly high.

Just do not overdo it. You do not need to animate everything. The examples below are tech demos, not a serious suggestion for how to handle your animations. Avoid distractions, and do not slow your users down. While you admire your beautiful 3-second animation, your users might prefer something that moves a little faster.


### Typical Usage Scenarios


Content-heavy websites are often very static, and you might wonder where in-page animations could actually help your users. In general, you might use them

- to draw attention to certain parts of the page
- to highlight structural relationships when something changes, for example, showing that one element moved from here to there
- to make change feel more dynamic and entertaining and boost how users engage with your site

Whether you use the API on navigation or for animations on your page: The View Transition API is most useful when you want to animate changes to entire subtrees in the DOM. The core benefit of the View Transition API is that it creates the things to animate. For all elements where you assign a `view-transition-name` CSS property, the API captures before-and-after snapshots of the DOM and gives you [images you can animate](https://vtbag.dev/basics/pseudos/).

You get three polished [default animations](https://vtbag.dev/basics/default-animations/) out of the box: fade-in, fade-out, and morph. But you are not locked in. The animation is fully up to you. You can move, style, or reorder the captured images however you like. When the animations finish, the transition ends, and everything returns to its normal DOM flow.


Having said that, typical use cases for the View Transition API are those where you can take advantage of the image nature of the captured content. These usually involve transformations like scaling, rotation, or translation. Filter effects also work well.

What you can't do is alter the content of the captured old images themselves. For example, if you capture a block of text, you cannot change its color or font in the old image during the view transition. Teaser: You can do all that with the new image.

And do not treat everything like a nail just because you now have a hammer. In many cases, simple animation effects do not need the View Transition API. If only individual elements need animation, like an image, it is often enough to use regular CSS animations or even just CSS transitions. The View Transition API really pays off when you want to animate more complex differences between before and after states of the DOM.



## Demo Time

This section showcases two demos of same-document use of the View Transition API in an Astro project. Both make great use of animating the difference between the before and after states of a DOM change.

### Theme Switcher

First, the classic case: just one old image and one new image, both covering all the HTML elements of the entire viewport, and a very simple DOM change:
```js
document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark');
```
No need to explicitly add view transition names in this case. The API automatically assigns the name `root` to the `document.documentElement` if no name is set. The snapshots of the `<html>` element are special as they are the size of the viewport, not the whole page.

Now that the View Transition API hands you the light and dark images, you can do some fun stuff with them: while the old screen stumbles backward and drops out of view, we quickly smooth in the new background, and just like that, everything is ready and interactive again! **Click the orb below** to trigger the theme switcher demo.

<div class="grid-row not-content"><ThemeChanger2 /></div>

<style>{`
.grid-row {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: max-content;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

`}</style>

There is no way to capture images of the entire viewport this easily in JavaScript without the View Transition API. You would either have to rely on external libraries like `html2canvas`[^1]  or explicitly ask users for permission to capture their screen.

[^1]: Ping me if you know a good one.



We ignore or override all default animations. Here are our custom animations&hellip;
```css
::view-transition-group(root) {
	animation-name: none;
}
::view-transition-old(root) {
	animation-name: tumble;
	z-index: 1;
}::view-transition-new(root) {
	animation-name: grow;
	border-radius: 0;
	filter: url(#smoothing);
}

```
The View Transition API stacks the new image on top of the old one. In our example, this means the new image would completely obscure the old one, making the tumbling effect invisible. Setting the old image's `z-index` to 1 brings it above the new one.

And these are the keyframe definitions:
```css
@keyframes grow {
	from {transform: scale(0.8);}
	to {transform: scale(1);}
}
@keyframes tumble {
	10% {transform: scale(0.8) rotateX(72deg);}
	15% {transform: scale(0.6) rotate(5deg) translateX(20vw) rotateX(108deg);}
	60% {transform: scale(0.5) rotate(-10deg) translateX(0vw) rotateX(360deg);}
	80% {transform: scale(0.5) rotate(5deg) translateX(20vw) rotateX(360deg);}
	100% {transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg) translateY(100vh) rotateX(360deg);}
}
```


The smoothing effect is achieved using an SVG filter:
```html
<svg width="0" height="0">
	<filter id="smoothing" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
		<feTurbulence type="turbulence" baseFrequency="0.02" numOctaves="2" result="turbulence"></feTurbulence>
		<feDisplacementMap id="displacement" in="SourceGraphic" in2="turbulence" xChannelSelector="R" yChannelSelector="G">
			<animate attributeName="scale" from="20" to="1" dur="2s"></animate>
		</feDisplacementMap>
	</filter>
</svg>
```
Actually, the current code does not use the SVG animation element but instead relies on a JavaScript function to animate the `scale` during the view transition:
```js
const animate = () => {
	const position = Date.now() - start;
	if (position < DURATION_MS) {
		displacement?.setAttribute('scale', `${30 - (position / DURATION_MS) * 30}`);
		requestAnimationFrame(animate);
		}
}
```

### The Card Deck

The card deck demo always displays three cards from a deck. You can move forward and backward through the deck using the buttons. To see how unintuitive the card deck feels without view transitions, use the dropdown at the bottom to turn them off.

<ExampleCarsel />

The basic strategy here is to give all cards a `view-transition-name` and rely on the View Transition API's group animation to move the cards around. The cards themselves look the same before and after the click, so we can drop the cross-fade animations:
```css
::view-transition-old(*),
::view-transition-new(*) {
	animation-name: none;
}
```
There are some minor tweaks that add a bit of dynamic by starting the cards with a little relative delay:
```css
::view-transition-group(*) {
	animation-delay: 50ms;
}
::view-transition-group(carsel-0),
::view-transition-group(carsel-3) {
	animation-delay: 30ms;
}
::view-transition-group(carsel-2) {
	animation-delay: 0ms;
}
```
And finally, the cards glide a big more into the foreground or into the background as they move:
```css
:active-view-transition-type(up)::view-transition-image-pair(carsel-0) {
	animation-delay: 0ms; animation-name: mini;}

:active-view-transition-type(down)::view-transition-image-pair(carsel-1) {
	animation-delay: 80ms; animation-name: maxi;}

::view-transition-image-pair(carsel-2) {
	animation-delay: 40ms; animation-name: maxi;}

:active-view-transition-type(down)::view-transition-image-pair(carsel-3) {
	animation-delay: 0ms; animation-name: mini;}

:active-view-transition-type(up)::view-transition-image-pair(carsel-6) {
	animation-delay: 80ms; animation-name: maxi;}

@keyframes maxi {33%,66% {transform: translateX(15px) translateZ(7.5cm)}}
@keyframes mini {10%,90% {transform: translateX(-200px) translateZ(-7.5cm); opacity:0.5;}}
```

If you want CSS to apply 3D effects to the image pairs, you also need to explicitly set a perspective on their parent elements:
```
	:active-view-transition-type(carsel) {
		&::view-transition-group(*) {
			perspective: 50cm;
		}
		...
	}
```
The rest of the styling are timing settings and a bit of `z-index` shuffling like we did with the theme switcher above.

## Whatever it Takes on a Real Page

With the tips above, you are now well equipped to envision some vivid same-page view transitions. But doing a demo on Codepen and integrating the same component on a real web site are two different things, especially when you want to have several component on the same page or when you also use cross-document view transitions and do not want all those thing interfere.

Here is what we will look into:
- starting same-page view transitions
- scoping view transitions
- retaining the page interactive

### Starting

[Starting a view transition](https://vtbag.dev/basics/javascript/#startviewtransition) is as simple as calling `document.startViewTransition(callback)` with a function that updates the DOM from its current state to the next.

Of course, you will want to check whether the browser actually supports this function. Otherwise, your code could crash.

It is also a good idea to check whether users prefer reduced motion, and to respect that preference by disabling or toning down animations.

At least in the same-document case we do not have to think about render blocking.

It is not a lot to handle, but still, some convenience would not hurt: \
The Bag’s `mayStartViewTransition()` function takes care of all the above and more. It also lets you automatically chain closely timed calls into a single transition.

Here is how to access it in an Astro file after installing the package with `npm i @vtbag/utensil-drawer`.

Just keep in mind: [it is still a bit experimental](https://vtbag.dev/tools/utensil-drawer/#maystartviewtransition).



```html
<script>
  import {mayStartViewTransition} from '@vtbag/utensil-drawer/mayStartViewTransition'

  mayStartViewTransition(...)
```

### Scoping
If you are using cross-document animations on your site (through the browser's `@view-transition { navigation: auto }` or Astro’s `<ClientRouter />`), calling `startViewTransition()` could well open the gates to visual mayhem.

Until [_scoped_ view transitions](https://vtbag.dev/basics/javascript/#scoped-view-transitions) become widely supported, view transitions apply to the entire document. Calling `startViewTransition()` generates images for all elements with a view transition name and triggers  animations on all of them.

It does not matter whether you assign view transition names to the cards in your Card Deck, the `:root` element for your Theme Switcher, or your `<main>` element for a smooth slide animation on cross-document navigation. When the view transition starts, every element with a view transition name activates simultaneously.


This happens regardless of whether the view transition is triggered by navigation or by pressing a button that calls `startViewTransition()`. So navigating to a page with cross-document view transitions will also immediately run all same-document animations that have view transition names set up.


What we really want is a view transition confined to a single component. Let’s see how to put the chaos back in its box(es).

#### Guard Your Definitions

There are at least three alternative approaches to make sure that definitions do not interfere:
- dynamic, just in time creation of view transition names with JavaScript
- conditional definitions guarded by CSS classes
- conditional definition guarded by view transition types

**Temporary View Transition Names:** With this approach, you make sure that view transition names only exist when the API is actually looking for them. As you already need browser-side JavaScript to start the view transition, you could as well add the view transition names just before you call `startViewTransition()` and remove them after the new images are captured. Cleanup can be done in a finally clause for the view transitions ready promise:
```js
setViewTransitionNamesForOldImages();
const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
	update();
	setViewTransitionNamesForNewImages();
});
transition.ready.finally(removeViewTransitionNames)
```
If you want `setViewTransitionNamesForNewImages` can also remove names for old images. Alternatively you might be able to set all names, both old and new, before the view transition starts. In that case, you can simply skip using something like `setViewTransitionNamesForNewImages`.

To make this work, make sure the view transition names in your different use cases do not overlap. This avoids  conflicts in pseudo-element styling and removes the need for extra logic to conditionally apply styles. If a view transition name does not exist, the API won't generate pseudo-elements for it, so any associated styles  will have no effect.

**CSS Classes as Guards:** Alternatively, you can add a class, e.g. `.card-deck`, to the `:root` element while your Card Deck view transition component is active. Like with temporary set view transition names, you set this before you call `startViewTransition()` and you reset it in the finally clause of the view transition's `finished` promise. You can than use `:root.card-deck` to guard all view transition definitions, especially the definitions of view transition names. This will guarantee that those names do only exist while the `.card-deck` class is set on the `:root` element.

```astro
<style is:global>
	:root.card-deck {
		button.next {
			view-transition-name: next-button;
		}
		&::view-transition-group(root) {
			animation-duration: 180ms;
		}
	}
	...
```
By not clearing the class before `finished` resolves, you can even assign different definitions to the same view transition pseudo-elements in different contexts. Note that the use of & is mandatory here, as we want to address `:root.card-deck::view-transition-group(root)` (without a space) and not `.root.card-deck ::view-transition-group(root)` with a space.


**View Transition Types as Guards:** Timing the addition and removal of a guarding CSS class can be a bit tricky. You might have already noticed that using a CSS class like this is similar to how [view transition types](https://vtbag.dev/basics/styling/#with-types) work. And yes, while view transition types are a relatively new addition to the View Transition API and might not yet be fully supported in all browsers, they offer some strong advantages.

Types are available as soon as `startViewTransition()` is called, so you can use them to guard view transition names during the capture of old and new images. They also remain active until just after the finished promise resolves, which means you can use them to guard pseudo-element styling throughout the animation. As a bonus, the type is automatically removed once the transition ends. No manual cleanup needed.

You define the types when calling `startViewTransition()`:
```js
document.startViewTransition({update, types: ['card-deck','up']});
```
And you use them much like the CSS class approach:
```astro
<style is:global>
	:active-view-transition-type(card-deck) {
		button.next {
			view-transition-name: next-button;
		}
		&::view-transition-group(root) {
			animation-duration: 180ms;
		}
	}
	...
```
This works because `:active-view-transition-type(...)` _matches the document element_ if any of the listed types is active during the current view transition. Thus `:active-view-transition-type(card-deck) { button {` is effectively the same as `:root button {`, which in turn is just the same as `button {`, aside from differences in specificity.


#### Erase Other View Transition Names
Guarding the `:root` with a class or a view transition type can also be used to temporarily disable all globally defined, unguarded view transition names so they do not interfere with your current same-document transition:
```astro
<style is:global>
	:active-view-transition-type(card-deck) {
		*:not(div.card-deck-root *), & {
			view-transition-name: none !important;
		}
	}
	...
```
Here `div.card-deck-root` is the root element of our card deck. The CSS rule erases view transition names on all elements that are not part of the card deck. Note that `!important` rules can not only override rules in stylesheets but even names set using a `style` attribute on an element.

Removing all other view transition names also clears the effects of any other view transitions defined on this page, as well as those from cross-document view transitions, again assuming that names do not overlap.

This solution is general and quick to write, but it can be a performance burden. If possible, make sure all other view transition names are set within guards, and try to use a more specific selector to clear any remaining view transition names.



### Restoring Interactivity
The `::view-transition` pseudo-element covers the entire viewport. You might view this pseudo simply as the root where all the `::view-transition-group` pseudos are attached, but it also [acts like a glass pane](https://vtbag.dev/basics/pseudos/#rendering-pseudo-elements), blocking  all mouse clicks from reaching the page underneath.

So even if you can see the button for moving through the Card Deck, you can not click then.

The [fix](https://vtbag.dev/tips/interactivity/#how-to-retain-interactivity) is simple. In most cases letting the pointer through is all it needs:
```css
::view-transition {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```
That way you can interact with section of your page that are not obscured by pseudo-elements.


## Astro Specifics
As I hinted in the introduction, most of what we covered here is not specific to Astro.
Just the usual suspects and a few framework-specific lines here and there.

- If you are using Astro's `<ClientRouter />` for view transitions, you need to attach your event handlers using Astro's lifecycle events, just like you normally would. As the handler runs on every navigation, you should check if there is something to do on the current page:
```js
document.addEventListener('astro:page-load', () => {
	const carsel = document.querySelector('div.carsel');
	if (!carsel) return;
	...
});
```
- Astro’s scoped styles can interfere with the CSS selectors used by the View Transition API. To avoid issues, use `<style is:global>`, `<style is:inline>`, or the `:global()` pseudo-class where needed.
- Astro automatically turns plain `<script>` tags into `<script type="module">`. That means you can use import statements directly, e.g. for `mayStartViewTransition`. If you are not using Astro, make sure to add `type="module"` yourself so import statements work as expected.


Happy transitioning!
