## Testing for View Transition Support in CSS

You can test whether the user's browser has native support for view transition like this:

```css
/* has native support for view transitions */
@supports(view-transition-name: a) {
  ...
}
/* does not natively support view transitions */
@supports not(view-transition-name: a) {
  ...
}
```

## Ignored Style Rules

Browsers that do not support view transitions may cough and choke when fed CSS for view transitions.

While it is apparent that they do not support the `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements, some other consequences are not so obvious.

* Setting the `view-transition-name` CSS property is not harmful in browsers without support for view transitions. But the property is simply ignored, and you cannot access it in the DOM.

* In JavaScript, you should not access `element.style.viewTransitionName` or similar accessors to view transition CSS properties if the browser does not support view transitions natively. This will likely throw errors.


* Do not combine selectors with view transition properties with normal selectors in CSS rules. The browser will likely ignore the entire rule, including the part that does not contain a view transition. Here is an example:

```css title="pitfall.css" {2}
::view-transition-group(main),
body main {
  ...
}
```
Although the highlighted section is correct, browsers may completely ignore the entire rule due to the unknown pseudo element selector.
