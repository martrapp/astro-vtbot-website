## Other's have a Backlog, I've got a *ðŸ‘œ Baglog âœ¨* ;-)

* Why does it not simply work when I add `transition-*` directives to an Astro component like in `<MyCard transition:animate="fade">`

* How to combine CSS for view transitions with media queries

* How to have a sticky video from the moment on when you first came across that page with the video

* A Common abstraction across Astro's view transitions and Level 2 View Transition API?

* How to order scripts plus ideas about a plugin system for view transitions

* how to drag styles for persisted elements to the next page

* how to optimize view transitions by clipping the images (is that possible?) and removing transitions that are off-viewport

* how to make a decent loading screen that covers the target page on load and is than withdrawn (with or without view transitions)

* timing behavior of view transitions (rendering does not start before the whole DOM is loaded and parsed)

* how to synchronize JavaScript animations with view transitions

* how to craft scripts and components that can be used with and without view transitions

* What it is worth to know that `view-transition-name` is discretely animatable

* Explain the stacking order of new and old images

* how to have the view transition move **behind** some elements in the front?

* how to set break points to investigate the pseudo elements

* different order of components / eventListeners in DEV & PROD and how to fix that

* Persisting elements as an alternative to script re-initialization, especially dynamically created ones e.g. chat apps
