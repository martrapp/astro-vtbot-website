title: Add Astro's View Transitions to Starlight for that SPA-like Look & Feel
---

import BoT from "/src/components/BoT.astro"
import AnimateImages from "/src/components/AnimateImages.astro"

This guide describes what has to be done to add view transitions to an existing Starlight site using the Starlight support of the <BoT/>.

<div style="background-color:#9872; border-radius: 9px; padding: 2ex; box-shadow: #00000028 1.6px 1.6px 3.2px 0px">
The benefits of doing this include:
* Looks like a Single Page Application: No full page reloads anymore
* Behaves like a Single Page Application: Search terms, sidebar scroll position and collapsed category states are retained across navigation (No wild animations or automatic closing by default if you are worried when looking at this site's sidebar ;-D )
* Enables you to easily add visual transition effects to your site
* Has fallback support for browser that do not yet implement the View Transition API
</div>

Don't be afraid that this will turn your beautiful website into a blinking jukebox. This Jotter is just an exaggerated example to show what is possible. If you follow the instructions below, you will be rewarded with a very _subtle_, SPA-like transition effect. And yes, if you want, you can of course later turn the whole thing into a ... blinking jukebox.

The [introduction page on The Bag's view transition support for Starlight](/jotter/starlight/#will-the-bag-offer-support-for-starlight) defines three categories of features for The Bag's view transition support. This guide currently covers level 1, the mandatory features.

I'm currently working on making the optional features available as reusable components as well and will then extend this guide.

<div style="background-color:#9872; border-radius: 9px; padding: 2ex; box-shadow: #00000028 1.6px 1.6px 3.2px 0px">
The Bag's support of view transition for Starlight is still young and has not yet been extensively tested in the wild. Enjoy being on the bleeding edge of technology with your Starlight site, but also be prepared that things might break when updating to a newer version or The Bag. Or that not everything you expect will be possible right from the start. I'm happy to improve and expand the initial support over time!
</div>

## Step 1: Install astro-vtbot

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-vtbot" target="_blank"><img style="margin:2ex 0; height:20px"  src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/astro-vtbot?style=plastic&logo=npm&label=astro-vtbot&color=rgba(0%2C200%2C200%2C0.5))" data-zoom-off/></a>
The <BoT/> is available on npm. The package is named `astro-vtbot`.
It can be installed as a package or as an Astro integration. See the [installation page](/library/Installation/) for details and differences. Let's assume you just want to add it as a package:

```sh
cd /to/my/starlight/project
npm i -D astro-vtbot
```
Make sure that you have the latest version installed.

## Enable View Transitions

To enable view transitions, we extend Starlight's  **`Head`** component. We create a replacement component and instruct Starlight to use it as a substitute for its Head. Here is [a pointer](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) to background information on how overriding components works.

The replacement component covers all aspects classified as [mandatory actions](/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/#mandatory-actions).

Components to cover the more optional things are in the works!

### Step 2: Create the New Head Component
Create a new component inside your project. The file name does not matter. For this example, we choose `./src/components/starlight/Head.astro`. You can copy & paste the content for this file:

```astro title="./src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
---
import type { Props } from '@astrojs/starlight/props';
import StarlightHead from '@astrojs/starlight/components/Head.astro';
import VtbotStarlight from 'astro-vtbot/components/starlight/Base.astro';
---

<VtbotStarlight {...Astro.props}>
	<StarlightHead {...Astro.props}><slot /></StarlightHead>
</VtbotStarlight>
```

### Step 3: Use the New Head Component

Now we tell Starlight to replace its `Head` component with ours. Open the `astro.config.mjs`[^1] file from your project directory. Make it look like shown below: Make sure that there is an entry named `components` in the options of your Starlight integration. It must specify a `Head` entry with the path of the file you have just created.

[^1]:Assuming `.mjs` as the extension here but `.ts` would also be fine. of course!

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {8-9}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlight from "@astrojs/starlight";

export default defineConfig({
	...
	integrations: [starlight({
		...
		components: {
			Head: "./src/components/starlight/Head.astro",
			...
		},
		...
	})]
})
```

<details>

<summary>You already had a different entry for `Head:` in your `astro.config.njs` file?</summary>

> In this case you have to change the `import` of `StarlightHead` in your new `Head` component. Change the import so that it does not load Starlight's standard `Head`, but the  component you had in your components mapping before:

```astro title="./src/components/starlight/Head.astro" del={4} ins={5}
---
// The file you had in you components mapping for Head before now goes here:
// You probably might have to change "./src" to "/src" to ensure the component is found
import StarlightHead from '@astrojs/starlight/components/Head.astro';
import StarlightHead from '/src/components/MySpecialHead.astro';
...
```

</details>

### Try it out for yourself!
Start your project. No matter what browser you use, you should see that there are no full page loads when navigating. The scroll bar and category toggles do not reset when you go to the next page. The search bar remembers your last entry.

In Chromium browsers, you will see the browser's standard animations for few transitions, i.e. a very quick fade-over of the complete viewport. Browser without native support for view transition will not yet show animations, but just seamlessly swap pages.[^2]

[^2]: Having no fancy, whole viewport animation on a browser without native view transition support is a good thing here. As the exit and entry animations are required to play in sequence, you can not get a real cross-fade. But see [here](#animating-the-main-section) on how to add a cool animation to the main section.

:::note[Congratulations!]
If you were just looking for a SPA-like navigation, you are all set!
:::

In the next section, we will extend the view transition effect by adding an animation to the main content area and optimizing the styling.

## Configuring View Transitions

You can configure several aspects of the view transition effect in your new `Head` component.


### Animating the Main Section

You can add a `transition:animate=...` [directive](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#built-in-animation-directives) to the `<VtbotStarlight>` component. The Bag will teleport the directive from there to the `<main>` element of the Starlight page.  This is the way to enable view transition animations for the main content area of a Starlight site for all browsers.

```astro title="How to add animations to the main area"
<VtbotStarlight {...Astro.props} transition:animate="fade">
	<StarlightHead {...Astro.props}><slot /></StarlightHead>
</VtbotStarlight>
```
If you want to add further styling to the transition group, you can explicitly name it by accompanying `transition:animate` with `transition:name="..."`. This way you replace the random name that Astro automatically gereted for you with a chosen name that you can use in CSS rules, see the [extended configuration example](#extended-configuration-example) below.

### Fallback Control
What [behavior](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#fallback-control) do you want for browsers that do not support view transitions natively? Choose from `none`, `swap` or `animate`. Use the `viewTransitionFallback` attribute of the `<VtbotStarlight>` component to tell The Bag what you have chosen:

```astro title="How to specify the fallback option of <ViewTransitions/>"
<VtbotStarlight {...Astro.props} viewTransitionsFallback="animate">
	<StarlightHead {...Astro.props}><slot /></StarlightHead>
</VtbotStarlight>
```
This only serves as an example. It is not necessary to set `viewTransitionsFallback` to `animate` as this is the default setting anyway.

### Sidebar Behavior
By the default, the sidebar content will not change on navigation. Only the current page marker will be changed, opened, and scrolled into view. There are several ways how [you can change this behavior](#customize-the-sidebar).


### Additional Styling

You can also add a `<style is:global>` section to the file to style the `::view-transition-*` pseudo elements for browsers with native view transition support.


### Extended Configuration Example

Let's revisit our `Head` component and see how it looks with the extensions described above:

```astro title="./src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
---
import type { Props } from '@astrojs/starlight/props';
import StarlightHead from '@astrojs/starlight/components/Head.astro';
import VtbotStarlight from 'astro-vtbot/components/starlight/Base.astro';
import LoadingIndicator from 'astro-vtbot/components/LoadingIndicator.astro';
// import one of Astro's predefined animation functions,
// see https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#built-in-animation-directives
import { slide } from 'astro:transitions';
---

{/* Define a view transition animation for `<main>`*/}
<VtbotStarlight
	{...Astro.props}
	transition:name="main" transition:animate={slide({ duration: 150 })}>
	<StarlightHead {...Astro.props}><slot /></StarlightHead>
</VtbotStarlight>

{/* update this one to whatever image you want to show as a loading indicator */}
<LoadingIndicator top="80px" right="16px" src="/favicon.svg" />

<style is:global>
	/* Slow down Chrome's default animation */
	::view-transition-group(root) {
		animation-duration: 300ms;
	}

	/* Do not slide over the sidebars */
	::view-transition-group(main) {
		overflow: hidden;
	}
	/* For non-native-view-transition browsers */
	.main-pane {
		overflow: hidden;
	}

	/* let title headings morph into each other */
	main h1 {
		view-transition-name: title-heading;
	}
	::view-transition-group(title-heading) {
		animation-duration: 0.3s;
	}
</style>
```

## Optional Features

This section shows how to add features from the [optional feature list](/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/#optional-part). This has just two entries right now but will soon grow further.

### Loading indicator
Independent of the Starlight support, The Bag provides [loading indicators](/library/LoadingIndicator/) for you to choose from. The above [example](#extended-configuration-example) already contains the indicator that makes your favicon flash happily in the top right corner during loading.

### Customize the Sidebar
In case you want to change the [default behavior of the sidebar](#sidebar-behavior), the <BoT/> offers some switches and utility functions.

#### Replace the Sidebar Content
You can have the content of the sidebar replaced on each navigation. To do this, add the `replaceSidebarContent` attribute to the `VtbotStarlight` tag in your [`Head` component](/jotter/starlight/guide/#step-2-create-the-new-head-component).
```astro title="/src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
<VtbotStarlight {...Astro.props} replaceSidebarContent>
```
This will swap in the sidebar content from the next page when you navigate. This allows you to have different sidebar content on your pages. It also allows you to control the state of the categories, i.e. whether they are shown open or collapsed, with your static page content. Auto-opening and auto-scrolling to the current page marker is not disabled by this switch.

#### Retain the Current Page Marker

If you want to take control over the current page marker yourself, you can switch of the default update by adding the `retainCurrentPageMarker` attribute to the `VtbotStarlight` tag in your [`Head` component](/jotter/starlight/guide/#step-2-create-the-new-head-component). This will also disable auto-opening and auto-scrolling to the current page marker.

```astro title="/src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
<VtbotStarlight {...Astro.props} retainCurrentPageMarker>
```
On navigation, this leaves the current page marker as is. If you already set the `replaceSidebarContent` attribute, you do not need `retainCurrentPageMarker`. To assist you in updating the page marker yourself, The Bag offers these utility functions:

```ts title="astro-vtbot/components/starlight/utils.ts"
// Return the <a> element inside the sidebar that best fits the URL parameter
export function sidebarEntry(url: URL): HTMLAnchorElement | null {...}

// Clears the current page marker in the sidebar without setting a new one
export function clearCurrentPageMarker(): void {...}

// Clears the current page marker and then sets it to the entry that best fits the URL
export function updateCurrentPageMarker(url: URL): void {...}

// Opens all nested categories of a sidebar entry. Without url parameter, opens the entry of the current page marker. With url parameter opens the corresponding sidebarEntry(url). You can set scrollIntoView to false to prevent the entry to be scrolled into view.
export function openCategory(url?: URL, scrollIntoView = true): void {...}

```
Here _best fit_ in general means _exact match_, but if there is none, it also looks for the longest common prefix.

To use the utility functions, import one ore more from `astro-vtbot/components/starlight/utils`:
```astro title="MySidebarAnimations.astro"
---
---
<script>
  import { clearCurrentPageMarker, updateCurrentPageMarker, sidebarEntry } from 'astro-vtbot/components/starlight/utils';
  ...
</script>
```

### Eliminate Pseudo-Scrolling

The default morph animations might look irritating when applied to elements that are larger than the current viewport. This is typical the case if you add an animation to your main area.  There is a [whole section on the effect](/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/transitions/#the-pseudo-scrolling-main-area) and possible solution in this Jotter.

If you just want to get rid of it, add the following to your [`Head` component](/jotter/starlight/guide/#step-2-create-the-new-head-component):
```astro title="/src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
---
//...
import PageOffset from 'astro-vtbot/components/PageOffset.astro';
---
...
<PageOffset name="main" />
```
For details on the PageOffset component see [its description](/library/PageOffset/).


### Page Order Directions

[In the overview](/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/#ordered-pages), I teased that it might be nice if the direction of the view transition would depend on the page order. Normally, whenever you click on a link, Astro plays a _forward_ animation and when you hit the browser back key, you see a _backward_ animation.
* If you have _previous_ and _next_ page links on the bottom of your page, clicking them starts _forward_ animations.
* Clicking page 1, page 2, page 1 in the sidebar in this order gives you three _forward_ animations.

This would not make a difference if you use the default fade animation as it looks the same forwards and backwards. But the default slide animation for example has a direction. And maybe your special Starlight animation has one, too.

The Bag has a component called `<PageOrder />` that you can add to your [`Head` component](/jotter/starlight/guide/#step-2-create-the-new-head-component). It automatically changes the order of normal navigation and history traversals. If you navigate to a page that is further down in the sidebar, that will be a _forward_ navigation. If you navigate to a page further up, this is _back_. If not both, the _from_ and the _to_ page are found in the sidebar, direction retains its original value.


```astro title="/src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
---
//...
import PageOrder from 'astro-vtbot/components/starlight/PageOrder.astro';
---
...
<PageOrder />
```

All Astro animations support forward and backward out of the box. But what, if you click on a link to your current page? Then the `<PageOrder />` component sets a third direction called _stay_. The default animations interpret unknown directions as _forward_. This is usually fine and you are all set!


 <details>

 <summary>If you want to add a special animation for your the _stay_ direction, &hellip;</summary>

&hellip; you can do so by adding CSS for it:
```astro title="/src/components/starlight/Head.astro"
...
<style is:global>
	@keyframes stay-refresh {
		  0% { opacity: 1; }
		  1% { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0px); }
		 99% { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(100px); }
		100% { opacity: 0; }
	}
	[data-astro-transition='stay']::view-transition-old(main) {
		animation: stay-refresh 0.2s ease-in-out both;
	}
	[data-astro-transition='stay']::view-transition-new(main) {
		animation: stay-refresh 0.1s 0.2s reverse ease-in-out both;
	}
	[data-astro-transition-fallback='old'][data-astro-transition='stay'] main {
		animation: stay-refresh 0.2s ease-in-out both;
	}
	[data-astro-transition-fallback='new'][data-astro-transition='stay'] main {
		animation: stay-refresh 0.1s reverse ease-in-out both;
	}
</style>
```
Another page in the Jotter [explains why you need four definitions](/jotter/astro/directives/#transitionanimate) and what purpose they serve. The rules with `::view-transition-...(main)` address the transition named "main" for browsers that do have native view transition support. The last two rules address the `<main>` element for browsers that don't.

Refrain from merging rules with pseudo-elements with rules without pseudo-elements. Browsers treat unknown elements or properties as errors and [discard the entire rule](/jotter/snippets/css-tricks-pitfalls/#ignored-style-rules), even if they could understand half of the selector.

</details>

## Custom Combo Options

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import DemoHead3 from 'src/components/starlight/DemoHead3.astro?raw'

What follows is a yet more extended version of the [extended configuration example](#extended-configuration-example), but without the styling examples. It is not meant to be copied over into your `Head` but rather as a showcase what optional components you might mix and match in your own `Head` component. The section with the optional components is highlighted.


<Code code={DemoHead3} lang="astro" title="./src/components/starlight/Head.astro" ins={[5,6,7,15,16,18,19,21,22]} />


## Known Issues

There are some facts that you should be aware of. None of them is a real obstacle on using The Bag's Starlight support.

### View Transitions into Your Starlight Site from the Outside

If you link to a page of your Starlight site from the outside, you should not use view transitions, but do a full page load instead. This way, your Starlight site will be properly initialized  This is also important if you  create a link between two Starlight sites.

The website of The Bag automatically intercepts all links that return to the `/jotter/` and does a full page load. The Bag will soon offer a reusable component to facilitate that.

### Not tested with arbitrary config options
Starlight supports a lot of different config options. The Bags view transition support is so far only tested with a few typical combinations.

Multilingual Starlight sites force a complete reload of the page if you select a different language. This is a good thing, as the app frame changes completely and has to be reloaded anyway.

### Starlight Image Zoom

If you are using the `starlight-image-zoom` plugin (highly recommended!), make sure you are using the latest version.

### How to use `transition:persist`
The Starlight integration of the <BoT/> is based on the [`<ReplacementSwap/>` component](/library/ReplacementSwap/), which automatically persists everything outside the `div.main-frame` area. If you are flexible where to place things, just put them somewhere outside the `div.main-frame`  to persist them and you are done.

As of v1.7.8 `<ReplacementSwap />` also handles `data-transition-persist` attributes in the document trees that are swapped in from the new page. You can use this to persist an element inside the `div.main-frame` area to keep its state on all Starlight pages.

## As always, feedback is very welcome!
