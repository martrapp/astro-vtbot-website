title: The Jotter on Starlight
---

import BoT from "/src/components/BoT.astro"

At some point I realized that I needed to structure my bits & pieces better and make them searchable to make them useful.

 The desire to add view transitions to Starlight is a logical, but not trivial venture. Others have done it before. Chapeau @Fryuni! This Jotter is also a tech demo for Starlight on View Transitions.


Starlight does a great job of supporting documentation sites. You really don't need view transitions on a documentation site to distract your audience from the content *unless you are a site about view transitions*. Starlight is an opinionated framework. It works best when you use it as it is intended and only customize what is designated to be customized.

Supporting view transitions for Starlight is not just about cross-fade navigation. There is a wide range of design options. Everyone has different preferences.

## Will the Bag offer Support for Starlight?

Yes, it has already started. The <BoT/> provides initial basic support for the transition from views to Starlight! In the future, in the best of all worlds, The Bag can provide small, independent gadgets that developers can combine as they wish. Keep your fingers crossed ;-) and stay tuned.

There are a few things that need to be changed to enable view transitions in Starlight. Others are more optional. The mandatory changes are covered by the initial support of view transitions for Starlight through The Bag. Other features will follow.

Read on if you want to know what encounters I had on my journey to a Starlight website with view transitions. **If you're here because you too want to add view transitions to your Starlight site**, then visit the [step-by-step guide](/jotter/starlight/guide/)

### Mandatory actions

Some changes are non-negotiable:

#### ViewTransitions
The minimum change a starlight site needs is the insertion of Astro's   `<ViewTransitions />` component for all pages. Next, we need a solution for all the stuff that needs to re-run on soft navigation. Typically you would use Astro's lifecycle events to reinitialize dark mode, search, etc.

#### Reinitialize or Keep State: ReplacementSwap
The Bags Starlight support takes a different approach. Instead of re-initializing things, we simply keep the same instances on all pages. You could do this with `transition:persist`. But The Bag wouldn't be The Bag if it didn't use The Bag's [`ReplacementSwap`](/library/ReplacementSwap/) component. It simply replaces the `.main-frame` `<div>` (and `<head>` elements) on each navigation and keeps the rest of the page.

#### Sidebar Navigation
Since we keep the sidebar navigation instance across navigation, we need support to dynamically update the current page marker on navigation.

#### Auto-close Mobile Sidebar
Starlight has a button to open the page navigation on small devices. Because we do not refresh the whole page, we also need a way to automatically close that menu on navigation.

### Optional Part

Some other things are truly optional.

#### Styling
You might want to add some animations to make the main content change look more interesting.

#### Additional Image Pairs
I gave the headings on the pages view-transition-names to make the change of pages more entertaining.

#### Loading Indicator
Next, you need a [loading indicator](/library/LoadingIndicator/) to show that the website has recognized the click and is doing something.

#### Ordered Pages
Starlight pages can be configured to display links to the previous and next page at the bottom of each page. Here "previous" and "next" mean: In the order in which they appear in the page navigation. Wouldn't it be cool if the page transition animation also used these directions? I was thinking the same thing!

#### Scroll Pseudo Images
If you have long pages, view transitions cause a lot of ["scrolling"](/jotter/api/#scroll) when you navigate them from a scrolled down position. You know that this is no scrolling but just the morph animation of two large, only partially visible objects. The effect is less confusing, if you scroll both pages to the top before the morphing starts.

#### Reload Fence
The next step is only necessary if your website also contains pages that are not provided by Starlight. I've added a fence that recognizes when I leave the Starlight section and navigate to the demo or component pages of the site (and vice versa).  For these navigation events, I replace view transitions with full page loads  to reinitialize state, such as search.


### Minors

The world will keep turning without or without what comes next.

#### Silent Catch
If you click rapidly or use the arrow keys to navigate quickly through the browser history, you will interrupt ongoing transitions. This will result in error messages in the browser console because you usually haven't been paying attention to promises that could be rejected. Better catch.

#### Swap Sound
Just can't do without an annoying sound when the view transition is running? This is the audio equivalent of a page animation. Choose from different swoops! Or how about a loud clockwork sound as the internal gears of the site turn and click?
