There are different ways to give your Starlight site a nice boost with view transitions. Your choice are mainly whether your want to go with Astro's client router or with browser-native cross-document view transitions. This page gives you a quick overview so you can pick the path that fits you best.

## Option 1: With Astro's &lt;ClientRouter />

The client router turns your Starlight site into a single page application. Your users enjoy smooth navigation without full page reloads.

This is the older approach from the time when browsers had no native support for cross-document view transitions.

Choose this option if you need shared state across navigation.


### What you get

<div id="first">
- SPA navigation that eliminates full page loads
- Works in all major browsers 
- Component state like search queries and results stay intact across navigation
- May require extra steps to re-initialize third party scripts after navigation
</div>


### What the Bag of Tricks adds

To simplify the use of Astro's client router, the Bag of Tricks offers a replacement for Starlight's default `<Head>` component and a three step setup to get everything running. It also includes suggestions and options to help you extend and customize your setup including additional styling and loading indicators.

<Image src={bot} alt="bot" data-zoom-off/>
<LinkCard

  href="/jotter/starlight/guide/"

></LinkCard>
</div>

## Option 2: Native View Transition API

This approach keeps your site close to a classic multi page setup while still hiding full page load by leveraging browser's native cross-document view transitions.

Choose this option if you prefer the framework agnostic web standard and can accept that Firefox might need a bit more time to catch up.

### What you get

<div id="second">
- SPA-like navigation even with full page loads
- Works in all major browsers except Firefox for now
- Can't share component state across navigation
- Third party scripts behave as they did before
</div>

### What the Bag of Tricks adds

The Bag of Tricks provides a Starlight plugin that enables cross-document view transitions and enhances the experience. It adjusts navigation flow, main area behavior, and page titles, adds directional animations, and polishes the overall appearance.

></LinkCard>
</div>


## Bonus: Most Minimalistic Approach
A very simple variant of Option 2. 

You're satisfied with the default cross-fade effect on navigation and can accept that the transitions would not yet show in Firefox? Then you can enable browser-native view transitions by simply adding the following lines to your [custom.css](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) and you are all set.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @view-transition {
	  navigation: auto;
  }
}
```

<style>{`

	:is(#first, #second) li::marker {
		font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
		font-weight: 800;
		content: "✔  ";
		color: #2e7d32;
	}
#first {
	li:nth-child(4)::marker{
  	content: "⚠  ";
 		color: #ffb400;
	}
}
#second {
	li:nth-child(2)::marker{
  	content: "⚠  ";
 		color: #ffb400;
	}
	li:nth-child(3)::marker {
  	content: "✘  ";
 		color: #c62828;
	}
}

.vtbot, .vtbag {
	display: flex;
	> img {
		width: 4rem;
		aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
		margin: 2rem 1rem 1rem 1rem;
	}
}
.vtbag img {
	width: 5rem;
  mask-image: radial-gradient(ellipse at center, white 35%, transparent 71%);

} 
`}</style>
