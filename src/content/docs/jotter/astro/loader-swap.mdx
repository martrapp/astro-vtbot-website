Astro's support for view transitions defines two functions that can be overridden by users.
The first is the `loader()` function, which is executed during the preparation phase, and the second is the `swap()` function, which is executed during the swap phase.

Both functions can be extended or replaced with custom code, see below.

[Some functionalities](../flow-events/) like the triggering of events and starting of animations is not covered by `loader()` and `swap()` and can not be exchanged by redefining them.


## Semantics

Together, the `loader()` and the `swap()` function provide the main functionality of [Astro's view transition processing](../flow-events/#process-flow). The view transition API provides an _update callback_ to switch the current browser document to its new state. While this callback is executing, rendering is stopped and the browser's view is frozen. Therefore it is important that updating the DOM happens really fast. But how can you load the next page over the network and be fast anyhow?

This is the main reason for the separation into a _preparation_ phase with the `loader()` function and a _swap_ phase with the `swap()` function. The `loader()` function does the heavy lifting. All the time consuming actions like fetching and parsing the target document will happen inside the `loader()` function. During the preparation phase, the user can still fully interact with the current page. Once the preparation is done, the `swap()` function can directly access the future DOM in memory and quickly swap in the future DOM for the current DOM.


### Loader

The `loader()` function runs between the `astro:before-preparation` and `astro:after-preparation` events. Its purpose is to load or otherwise construct the target DOM of the navigation. It stores the result in the `newDocument` property of the preparation event. During the subsequent swap phase, this value will also be available in the `newDocument` property of the swap event.

The `loader()` function is a asynchronous function and it can call and await other asynchronous functions. Astro will wait for settlement of the promise returned by `loader()` before it fires the `astro:after-preparation` event.

### Swap

The `swap()` function updates the current DOM at `window.document` to reflect the DOM that is stored in the `newDocument` property of the swap event. This is the document that the `loader()` created during the preparation phase.

The `swap()` function should only update the DOM. It is a synchronous function that can not wait for asynchronous task to complete. All prerequisites that need to be fulfilled for `swap()` to do its job should be moved out of the swap phase into the preparation phase and into the `loader()` function.

## Extending Defaults

Often you might want to add some extra code at the beginning or at the end of the `loader()` or `swap()` function. This can be done using the patterns shown in the next two section. They look rather similar. They main difference between them is that `loader()` is a asynchronous function and `swap()` is not.

### Extending loader()

The `loader()` function can be overwritten in the `astro:before-preparation` event.

This is the pattern for the extension of the `loader()` function:

```astro title=AugmentedLoader.astro collapse={2-6} {13-17} "async () => {" "await originalLoader()"
<script>
  import {
    isTransitionBeforePreparationEvent,
    TRANSITION_BEFORE_PREPARATION,
  } from "astro:transitions/client";

  /*
   * Add your code before and/or after the original loader()
   */
  document.addEventListener(TRANSITION_BEFORE_PREPARATION, augmentLoader);
  function augmentLoader(event: Event) {
    if (isTransitionBeforePreparationEvent(event)) {
      const originalLoader = event.loader;
      event.loader = async () => {
        // do stuff before the original loader
        await originalLoader(); // call original loader
        // do stuff after the original loader
      };
    }
  }
</script>
```
How can you be sure that what you named `originalLoader` is indeed is the original loader? You can't. it might as well be a new function some other event listener assigned to the `loader` property before. Several listener might cooperate and build a Chain of Responsibility by wrapping the loader in several layers like an onion.

### Extending swap()

And this is the pattern for extending the `swap()` function.

```astro title=AugmentedSwap.astro collapse={2-6} {13-17} "() => {"  "originalSwap()"
<script>
  import {
    isTransitionBeforeSwapEvent,
    TRANSITION_BEFORE_SWAP,
  } from "astro:transitions/client";

  /*
   * Add your code before and/or after the original swap()
   */
  document.addEventListener(TRANSITION_BEFORE_SWAP, augmentSwap);
  function augmentSwap(event: Event) {
    if (isTransitionBeforeSwapEvent(event)) {
      const originalSwap = event.swap;
      event.swap = () => {
        // do stuff before the original swap
        originalSwap(); // call original swap
        // do stuff after the original swap
      };
    }
  }
</script>
```

## The Inner Workings

There are also use cases where you want to replace the default behavior of the `loader()` or `swap()` functions. In this case, you may want to know what these functions do in detail so that you can provide useful replacements.

### Loader

The `loader()` function can be overwritten in the `astro:before-preparation` event. Its purpose is use the events data, especially `event.to`, to define `event.newDocument`, the future DOM that should be later swapped in.

These are implementation details, not part of the API and might change without prior notice. Here is a sketch of what the default implementation does:

<Steps>
1. Call `fetch()` to load the new document from the `event.to` URL. This also includes the correct handling of form data as POST requests and updating `event.to` if the fetch was redirected to another URL.

2. Make sure that the media type of the response indicates a valid form of HTML document.

3. Parse the response into `event.newDocument`.

4. Imitate browsers default behavior and remove `<no-script>` elements from the parsed document.

5. If the target page does not support the view transition router, fall back to a full page load,  unless we are posting form data.

6. Preload all style links.

7. In DEV mode, simulate the initialization of `client:only` components and add their dynamically generated styles to `event.newDocument`.
</Steps>

### Swap

The `swap()` function can be overridden in the `astro:before-swap` event. Its purpose is to quickly update the current DOM in `window.document` so that it resembles the document stored in `event.newDocument`.

These are implementation details, not part of the API and might change without prior notice. Here is a sketch of what the default implementation does:

<Steps>
1. Determine which of the scripts in `event.newDocument` should not be run between `astro:after-swap` and `astro:page-load`. These are the script that were already part of the previous page and were not marked with `data-astro-rerun`. Mark those scripts as already executed in `event.newDocument`.
2. Swap in the attributes of the `<html>` attribute. Typically the current attributes are just replaced with the ones from the new DOM.
3. Swap in the children of the `<head>` element. Instead of removing all existing elements and then add the new ones, it is helpful to keep those that are in both versions untouched to prevent FOUC. These are a) style sheet links with same href that are already present in both DOMs and b)
elements with same data-astro-transition-persist name in both DOMS.
4. Save the current input focus and text selection
5. Replace `window.document.body` with the `event.newDocument.body`
6. Replace elements in the now current body with the corresponding elements from the old body if they are marked with the same `data-astro-transition-persist` name in both DOMs. Elements with the same `data-astro-transition-persist` name can have different element types, attributes and children.7. Restore the previous input focus and text selection.
</Steps>

For attributes of the `<html>` element and child elements of the `<head>` element, the order might change during swap. If they are part of the current and the new DOM they are not moved/added/removed but just left unchanged. The `<html>` and `<head>` elements themselves as well as `window.document` are never removed or added.

Event listeners on `window` and `window.document` are retained. References to elements of the old DOM that didn't make it to the current DOM are invalid after swap. Event listeners for elements that are no longer part of the current DOM after the swap are never called and newly added elements have no listeners unless they have been explicitly set, e.g. by using  the `astro:after-swap` or `astro:page-load` handlers.

The <BoT/> offers several helpers if you want to redefine some aspects of the `swap()` function. See [https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot/blob/main/components/swap-utils.ts](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot/blob/main/components/swap-utils.ts)
