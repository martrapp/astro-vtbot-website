Astro's view transition support is described in the [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#lifecycle-events). The following sections give additional details on process and events.

Astro's view transition feature provides cross document transitions. It replace the full page load of normal browser navigation with a smooth animation while changing pages. Then it updates the browser history and the window's scroll position. In the end, it works like _normal_ navigation, but it feels more like the slick transitions within a single page app.

Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` use the [View Transition API](/jotter/api/) for browsers that support it natively. For other browsers, Astro provides a [simulation](/jotter/astro/differences/).

## Soft Load
When Astro introduced cross document view transitions, only Chrome supported real cross document view transitions and only after this experimental feature was explicitly enabled by the user. Support for cross document view transitions as defined in the [Level 2 View Transition API](/jotter/api/) is still in its infancy.

For browsers that do not have native support of the View Transition API, or only for Level 1, it is impossible to implement cross document view transitions without replacing the typical full page load. Instead a mechanism is required that allows to continue the execution of the code and to keep the state across the page switch. For Astro, this mechanism is also sometimes referred to as _soft load_ of new contents. There are some fundamental differences between the soft load and the typical full page load.

The most important difference is that a full page load completely resets the state of the window object before it loads the new page. This includes resetting all variables, the DOM at `window.document`, all scripts and the module loader. In contrast, Astro's soft load retains all state and attempts to change it so it corresponds to the target state.


## Triggers

There are  four types of actions that trigger Astro's View Transitions:

1. Clicking on a link (HTML `<a>` Element, SVG Anchor `<a>` and `<map><area>`)
2. Submitting a `<form>`
3. Pressing a browsers buttons for history navigation, using according keyboard shortcuts, or calls to `history` functions `back()`, `forward()`, or `go()`
4. Calling the [`navigate()` function](#navigate), which is provided by `astro:transitions/client`

Customization of the view transition is supported by [Astro's transition events](./#events) and a view transition object with three promises that resolve or reject at different points during the transition. For details see the [View Transition documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) on MDN. Users can use the events and the promises to trigger custom code.


## Processing Flow

Processing of the view transition flow begins with a preparation phase that by default loads the DOM of the target page.
Then the actual view transition begins, which takes a screenshot of the current view (green line), swaps the current DOM with the contents of the loaded DOM and then starts the animations that remove the old image and in parallel bring in the new image  (red line).

<Image src={router} alt="Structure of the View Transition Router" />

This is the behavior for browsers that have native view transition support. The `startViewTransition(../flow-events/)` function and the view transition promises are part of the View Transition API.

For browsers that have no native support for view transitions, things happen slightly different. The exit animation to remove the old page happens on the green arrow, the enter animation to bring in the new image happens on the red arrow. The core functionality of the `startViewTransition()` function and the view transition promises are provided by Astro.


In the completion phase, the newly added scripts are executed, the page title of the new route is announced for users of assistive technologies and some clean-up work is carried out at the end.

### Step by Step

The single steps of the processing are as follows:

<Steps id="foo">
0. Detect and cancel a previous view transition if it is still running
1. Fallback to a full page load for a cross origin navigation (no CORS)
2. Detection and handling of a same-page navigation, which does not trigger view transitions
3. Trigger `astro:before-preparation` event `e`
4. Fallback to a full page load if `e.defaultPrevented` is true
5. Start `e.loader()` and wait for end of asynchronous processing
6. Trigger `astro:after-preparation` event
7. Simulation only: start and wait for end of exit animations
8. Native API: Call `startViewTransition()` with steps  9. - 12. as the update callback. Starts exit and enter animations in parallel once update is done.
9. > Trigger `astro:before-swap` event `e`
10. > Run `e.swap()`
11. > Update browser history and scroll position
12. > Trigger `astro:after-swap` event
13. Simulation only: start entry animations
14. Start and await the loading (or error during loading) of new scripts
15. Trigger `astro:page-load` event
16. Announce route to assistive technologies
17. Wait for all animations to finish and clean up
</Steps>

## Events

The yellow blocks in the diagram above mark the positions in Astro's navigation processing at which events are triggered. There are five events.

- `astro:before-preparation` and `astro:after-preparation` at the beginning and end of the preparation phase.
- `astro:before-swap` and `astro:after-swap` at the beginning and end of the swap phase.
- `astro:page-load` during the closing phase.

The `astro:after-` events and the `astro:page-load` event are standard `Event` objects. Their main purpose is to allow the user code to react to the completion of a processing phase.

The `astro:before-*` events provide navigation-specific properties
that show details of the processing. Some of these properties are even writable to give users control over the behavior of navigation processing.

All five events fire on `window.document`.

### astro:before-preparation

``` ts
readonly from: URL // The page where the navigation started
to: URL // The destination of the navigation.
direction: Direction | string // The values directly supported by Astro are 'forward' and 'backward', but this can be extended to other values. This property is writable.
readonly navigationType: NavigationTypeString // 'traverse' | 'push' | 'replace'
readonly sourceElement: Element // If triggered by a link navigation, the anchor element. If triggered by form submission, the submitter (and if submitter is null, the form element). Can also be set via the sourceElement property of the options parameter on a call to navigate()
readonly info: any // If the transition was initiated by a call to navigate(), the value of options.info. Set to an empty object if undefined.
newDocument: Document // The DOM to be transitioned to. This can be an empty DOM if swap() manipulates the current DOM in place.
signal: AbortSignal // The AbortController signal of the navigation. The defaultLoader uses this to abort ongoing fetch operations. Any activity that is to be aborted if a new navigation starts before the previous one ends can attach itself to this signal.
readonly formData: FormData // Automatically filled in if the navigation was triggered by a form. If the navigation was triggered by a call to navigate(), the value of options.formData.
loader: () => Promise<void>  // A function that sets event.newDocument to the contents of event.to.
```

While the event listener code must run synchronously, the loader function will perform asynchronous actions.

The `loader` property initially holds Astro's built-in implementation for loading the contents of `event.to` into `event.newDocument`. An [event listener might override](../loader-swap/#extending-loader) the value of the `loader` property to define a completely independent implementation.

|                 |                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type            | `astro:before-preparation`         |
| TypeScript Type | `TransitionBeforePreparationEvent` |
| Cancelable      | yes                                |

### astro:before-swap

Most of the properties of the `astro:before-swap` event are identical to those of the `astro:before-preparation` event. The differences are:

- `direction` is `readonly` in `astro:before-swap`
- `formData` and `loader` are not defined in `astro:before-swap`
- the `astro:before-swap`event offers two additional properties:

``` ts
swap: () => void // Initially, Astro's built-in implementation of the swap() operation. The task of the swap operation is to update the current DOM, typically to reflect the contents of event.newDocument.
readonly viewTransition: ViewTransition // The object returned by startViewTransition().
```

For documentation on `startViewTransition` visit [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition). It is [possible to override](../loader-swap/#extending-swap) the built-in implementation of `swap()` by assigning to the `swap` property. Other than `loader`, `swap` does _not_ support asynchronous actions. Browser implementations of view transition put a rather rigid timeout on the code that can run during swap. Long running code should be moved to the loader callback.

| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Type            | `astro:before-swap`         |
| TypeScript Type | `TransitionBeforeSwapEvent` |
| Cancelable      | no                          |

## Navigate()

The navigate function gives you programmatic access to view transitions. When you call it, it starts the [processing flow described above](/jotter/astro/flow-events/#processing-flow).

The function accepts two parameters: the URL to be navigated to and an optional option parameter.

```ts
type Options = {
        history?: 'auto' | 'push' | 'replace';
        state?: any;
        info?: any;
        formData?: FormData;
        sourceElement?: Element;
};
async function navigate(href: string, options?: Options);
```

The function and its options are inspired by the [Navigation API's `navigate()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate).
* `history` controls whether the `navigate()` will change the browser's history by calling `history.pushState()` or `history.replaceState()`. The values of `push` and `auto` are equivalent  because the differences described as `NotSupportedError` at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate#exceptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate#exceptions) can not be triggered with Astro.
* `state` can be an arbitrary value that will be written into the browser's history state.
* `info`, `formData` and `sourceElement`: These are values that can be accessed in the [`astro:before-*` events](#events).

The function returns a promise that fulfills when the new page got swapped in and the history entry got written. It does not wait for the animation of the view transition.
