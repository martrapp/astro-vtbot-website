Astro's view transition support is described in the [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#lifecycle-events). The following sections give additional details on process and events.

## Triggers

There are  four types of actions that trigger Astro's View Transitions:

1. Clicking on a link (HTML `<a>` Element, SVG Anchor `<a>` and `<map><area>`)
2. Submitting a `<form>`
3. Pressing a browsers buttons for history navigation, using according keyboard shortcuts, or calls to `history` functions `back()`, `forward()`, or `go()`
4. Calling the function `navigate()`, which is provided by `astro:transitions/client`

Customization of the view transition is supported by [Astro's transition events](./#events) and a view transition object with three promises that resolve or reject at different points during the transition. For details see the [View Transition documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) on MDN. Users can use the events and the promises to trigger custom code.

## Processing Flow

Processing begins with a preparation phase that by default loads the DOM of the target page.
Then the actual view transition begins, which takes a screenshot of the current view (green line), swaps the current DOM with the contents of the loaded DOM and then starts the animations that remove the old image and in parallel bring in the new image  (red line).

This is the behavior for browsers that have native view transition support. The `startViewTransition(../flow-events/)` function and the view transition promises are part of the View Transition API.

For browsers that have no native support for view transitions, things happen slightly different. The exit animation to remove the old page happens on the green arrow, the enter animation to bring in the new image happens on the red arrow. The core functionality of the `startViewTransition()` function and the view transition promises are provided by Astro.


In the completion phase, the newly added scripts are executed, the page title of the new route is announced for users of assistive technologies and some clean-up work is carried out at the end.

### Step by Step

The single steps of the processing are as follows:

<Steps id="foo">
1. Fallback to a full page load for a cross origin navigation (no CORS)
2. Detection and handling of a same-page navigation, which does not trigger view transitions
3. Trigger `astro:before-preparation` event `e`
4. Fallback to a full page load if `e.defaultPrevented` is true
5. Start `e.loader()` and wait for end of asynchronous processing
6. Trigger `astro:after-preparation` event
7. Simulation only: start and wait for end of exit animations
8. Native API: Call `startViewTransition()` with steps  9. - 12. as the update callback. Starts exit and enter animations in parallel once update is done.
9. > Trigger `astro:before-swap` event `e`
10. > Run `e.swap()`
11. > Update browser history and scroll position
12. > Trigger `astro:after-swap` event
13. Simulation only: start entry animations
14. Run and await new scripts
15. Trigger `astro:page-load` event
16. Announce route to assistive technologies
17. Wait for all animations to finish and clean up
</Steps>

## Events

The yellow blocks in the diagram above mark the positions in Astro's navigation processing at which events are triggered. There are five events.

- `astro:before-preparation` and `astro:after-preparation` at the beginning and end of the preparation phase.
- `astro:before-swap` and `astro:after-swap` at the beginning and end of the swap phase.
- `astro:page-load` during the closing phase.

The `astro:after-` events and the `astro:page-load` event are standard `Event` objects. Their main purpose is to allow the user code to react to the completion of a processing phase.

The `astro:before-*` events provide navigation-specific properties
that show details of the processing. Some of these properties are even writable to give users control over the behavior of navigation processing.

All five events fire on `window.document`.

### astro:before-preparation

``` ts
readonly from: URL // The page where the navigation started
to: URL // The destination of the navigation.
direction: Direction | string // The values directly supported by Astro are 'forward' and 'backward', but this can be extended to other values. This property is writable.
readonly navigationType: NavigationTypeString // 'traverse' | 'push' | 'replace'
readonly sourceElement: Element // If triggered by a link navigation, the anchor element. If triggered by form submission, the submitter (and if submitter is null, the form element). Can also be set via the sourceElement property of the options parameter on a call to navigate()
readonly info: any // If the transition was initiated by a call to navigate(), the value of options.info. Set to an empty object if undefined.
newDocument: Document // The DOM to be transitioned to. This can be an empty DOM if swap() manipulates the current DOM in place.
readonly formData: FormData // Automatically filled in if the navigation was triggered by a form. If the navigation was triggered by a call to navigate(), the value of options.formData.
loader: () => Promise<void>  // A function that sets event.newDocument to the contents of event.to.
```

While the event listener code must run synchronously, the loader function will perform asynchronous actions.

The `loader` property initially holds Astro's built-in implementation for loading the contents of `event.to` into `event.newDocument`. An [event listener might override](../loader-swap/#extending-loader) the value of the `loader` property to define a completely independent implementation.

| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type            | `astro:before-preparation`         |
| TypeScript Type | `TransitionBeforePreparationEvent` |
| Cancelable      | yes                                |

### astro:before-swap

Most of the properties of the `astro:before-swap` event are identical to those of the `astro:before-preparation` event. The differences are:

- `direction` is `readonly` in `astro:before-swap`
- `loader` is not defined in `astro:before-swap`
- the `astro:before-swap`event offers two additional properties:

``` ts
swap: () => void // Initially, Astro's built-in implementation of the swap() operation. The task of the swap operation is to update the current DOM, typically to reflect the contents of event.newDocument.
readonly viewTransition: ViewTransition // The object returned by startViewTransition().
```

For documentation on `startViewTransition` visit [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition). It is [possible to override](../loader-swap/#extending-swap) the built-in implementation of `swap()` by assigning to the `swap` property. Other than `loader`, `swap` does _not_ support asynchronous actions. Browser implementations of view transition put a rather rigid timeout on the code that can run during swap. Long running code should be moved to the loader callback.
