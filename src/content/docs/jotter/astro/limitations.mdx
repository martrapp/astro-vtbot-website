title: Limitations of the Simulation
---

Astro simulates important aspects of view transitions for browsers that do not support them natively. But it can not mimic all aspects of a native implementation.

## Beyond JavaScript and CSS
The [detailed description](/jotter/api/details/) of the View Transition API reveals that some functions cannot be polyfilled without native browser support.
- Efficient saving a bitmap of an element from the current DOM as rendered in the current view[^1],
- Defining replaced elements that show a life view of the elements after swap
- Adding `::view-transition-*` pseudo elements to the `<html>` element
- Supporting the `view-transition-name` CSS property

[^1]: html2canvas might be a candidate for some limited ability to capture images.

Everything else could be achieved with JavaScript and CSS.

## Consequences for the Simulation


1. Without the ability to grab bitmaps, Astro cannot support parallel exit and entry animation. It must show the exit animation while the old DOM is still present, and cannot start the entry animations until the new DOM is loaded. As a result, exit and entry animations run sequentially and take longer in total than parallel the execution with built-in view transitions.

2. For the same reasons, Astro cannot support morph animations, as these require the simultaneous use of old and new images.

The lack of `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements and the CSS property `view-transition-name` can be remedied by additional data attributes on the HTML elements.

* See [here](/jotter/astro/directives/#transitionname) how Astro simulates `view-transition-name` properties with the  `data-astro-transition-scope` attribute.
* See [here](/jotter/astro/directives/#transitionanimate) how Astro simulates `::view-transition-old` and `::view-transition-new` with the `data-astro-transition-fallback` attribute.
