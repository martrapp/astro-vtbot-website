description: "The tips & tricks section of the Bag of Tricks for Astro's Client Router"
---

Tips & Tricks is a new category in the Bag. About time, right? After all, it is called the Bag of Tricks. You would expect a few tricks hiding in there. Now, two years in, they finally have their own spot on this site.

How is this different from the other tips you see here?

## What to Expect

The Tips & Tricks section will feature short articles that tackle one specific challenge and its solution. Most of them will be sparked by GitHub issues, #support threads on Astroâ€™s Discord, questions on Bluesky, or any other way **you** ask me for a how-to on something you want to achieve with view transitions in Astro. This might be about the client router or about naive view transitions. 

If I know the answer, there is a good chance that I will share it here.

And yes, view transition questions that are not Astro-specific are welcome too. Those will live over at [vtbag.dev](https://vtbag.dev).
