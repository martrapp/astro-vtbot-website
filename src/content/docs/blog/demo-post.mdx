## What is This Page About?

This page features both, the `starlight-blog` and the `starlight-image-zoom` integrations. Both are on vthe friendly neighbor list of the [Bag's guide for Starlight](/jotter/starlight/guide/). So the purpose of this page is to early detect degression in the Bag's view transition support for Starlight.

Thank you very much, [@trueberryless](https://trueberryless.org), for pointing out the issue where the two packages override each other and for taking care of the solution!
