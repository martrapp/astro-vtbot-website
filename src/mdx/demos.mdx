import BoT from '/src/components/BoT.astro'

The <BoT/> provides components that demonstrate Astro's View Transition API. Some of these are technical demos, some are useful tools, and some will evolve into reusable components that you can use in your own project to handle edge cases that go beyond Astro's standard features. The code of the Bag of Tricks is on [github:martrapp/astro-vtbot](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot)
