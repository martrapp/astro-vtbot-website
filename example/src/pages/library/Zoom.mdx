The zoom animation is a simple animation that zooms or shrinks the content of a transition group. For live examples visit the [animation demo page](/animations/one/) and select one of the `zoom` presets in the button filed at the top of the page.

## Contents

## Why would I use this component?

Astro allows users to create their own animations for view transitions. The `astro-vtbot` zoom animation is a ready-made solution that can be easily inserted into Astro's `transition:animate` property. It also supports parameters for fine-tuning the animation to your needs. It is even possible to customize the underlying keyframes when used together with the `<AnimationStyle/>` component.  

## Usage

[Install astro-vtbot](../Installation/) in your project running `npx astro add astro-vtbot` or `npm install astro-vtbot`.


### Basic usage

The most basic usage is to apply the 'zoom()' animation without any parameters. This will use the default values for the animation.

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
---
import { zoom } from "astro-vtbot/animations/zoom";
---
...
<h1 transition:animate={zoom()}>Zoom</h1>
...
```
The effect will zoom the old image to 500% while fading it out and it lets the new image grow from a point to 100% of its size while fading in. Reverse for the *backwards* direction. The animation will take 0.3 seconds and use the `ease-in-out` easing function.

### Parametrized usage

The default values for the animation can be overwritten by passing an object with the desired values to the `zoom()` function. The following example shows how to change the duration and easing of the animation.

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
---
import { zoom } from "astro-vtbot/animations/zoom";
---
...
<h1 transition:animate={zoom({duration:'1.5s', easing: 'cubic-bezier(.16,.73,.05,1.52)' })}>Zoom</h1>
...
```
You can set the following parameters:
| Property name | CSS property | Default value |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| duration      | animation-duration | 0.3s |
| easing        | animation-timing-function | ease-in-out |
| delay					| animation-delay | 0s |
| direction     | animation-direction | normal |
| fillMode			| animation-fill-mode | both |



###  Extended parametrized usage

If you want to use more than the 5 properties supported by `zoom()` or want to have more control over the animations keyframes, you can use the `customZoom()` function. This function takes a name for the transition and an object with the following optional properties:
* `keyframes`: An object with parameters for the keyframes for the animation.
* `base`: An object with the same properties as the `zoom()` function.
* `extensions`: An object with arbitrary CSS properties to be used in the forwards/backwards old/new animation.

The function returns a scope identifier to be used with the `data-astro-transition-scope` attribute of the HTML element you want to animate. Under the hood, `customZoom()` generates a style sheet with keyframe information and the defined CSS properties. You need to add these extended styles to your page by using the [`<AnimationStyle/>`](../AnimationStyle/) component. **Note:** Only use `<AnimationStyle/>` in conjunction with `customZoom()`, not with `zoom()`.

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
---
import { customZoom } from "astro-vtbot/animations/zoom";

const zoomScope = customZoom('myZoom', {
	keyframes: { scale: { forwardOut: 0, backwardIn: 0 } },
	base: { duration: '0.3s', easing: 'cubic-bezier(.16,.73,.05,1.52)' },
	animations: {
		forwards: { new: { 'animation-delay': '0.2s' } },
		backwards: { new: { 'animation-delay': '0.2s' } },
	},
});
---
...
<AnimationStyle name="myZoom"/>
<h1 data-astro-transition-scope={zoomScope}>Zoom</h1>
...
```
#### Keyframes

The keyframes object of the `customZoom()` function has the following properties:

```typescript
type ZoomKeyframeParameter = {
	scale?: { forwardOut?: number; forwardIn?: number; backwardOut?: number; backwardIn?: number; };
	opacity?: { forwardOut?: number; forwardIn?: number; backwardOut?: number; backwardIn?: number; };
};
```
The default values are all 0 with the exception of `forwards.out.scale` and `backwrds.in.scale` which are 5. 

<details>
<summary>The values are used as parameters in the following keyframe style sheet</summary>
```
@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}FwdZoomOut {
		from {
			transform: scale(1);
			opacity: 1;
		}
		to {
			transform: scale(${forwardOutScale});
			opacity: ${forwardOutOpacity};
		}
	}
	@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}FwdZoomIn {
		from {
			transform: scale(${forwardInScale});
			opacity: ${forwardInOpacity};
		}
		to {
			transform: scale(1);
			opacity: 1;
		}
	}
	@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}BwdZoomOut {
		from {
			transform: scale(1);
			opacity: 1;
		}
		to {
			transform: scale(${backwardOutScale});
			opacity: ${backwardOutOpacity};
		}
	}
	@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}BwdZoomIn {
		from {
			transform: scale(${backwardInScale});
			opacity: ${backwardInOpacity};
		}
		to {
			transform: scale(1);
			opacity: 1;
		}
	}
```

</details>

#### Base

The value of the `base` property is used to call the `zoom()` function as defined above.

#### Extensions

With the `extensions` property you can define all those CSS properties that can not be defined by `zoom()` directly. You can specify different values for `forwards` and `backwards`, `in` and `out` animations. These values are merged with the result of calling`zoom()` with base parameters and overwrite its properties.
