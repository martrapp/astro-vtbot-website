<h1 style="display: inline-block; view-transition-name: swing-1"><span style="display:inline-block; view-transition-name:swing-2">ðŸŽ·</span>The Swing Animation</h1>

The swing animation is a simple animation that rotates the content of a transition group. For live examples visit the [animation demo page](/animations/one/) and select one of the `swing` presets in the button grid at the top of the page.

## Contents

## Why would I use this component?

Astro allows users to create their own animations for view transitions. The `astro-vtbot` swing animation is a ready-made solution that can be easily inserted into Astro's `transition:animate` property. It also supports parameters for fine-tuning the animation to your needs. It is even possible to customize the underlying keyframes when used together with the `<AnimationStyle/>` component.  

## Usage

[Install astro-vtbot](../Installation/) in your project running `npx astro add astro-vtbot` or `npm install astro-vtbot`.

### Basic usage

The most basic usage is to apply the 'swing()' animation without any parameters. This will use the default values for the animation.

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
---
import { swing } from "astro-vtbot/animations/swing";
---
...
<h1 transition:animate={swing()}>Swing</h1>
...
```
The effect will rotate the *old*-image 90Â° around the y axis. When it complete vanished, the animation for the *new*-image kicks in and again rotates 90Â° back to the full view. The animation will take 0.15 seconds and use the `ease-in-out` easing function.

### Parametrized usage

The default values for the animation can be overwritten by passing an object with the desired values to the `swing()` function. The following example shows how to change the duration and easing of the animation.

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
---
import { swing } from "astro-vtbot/animations/swing";
---
...
<h1 transition:animate={swing({duration:'1.5s', easing: 'cubic-bezier(.16,.73,.05,1.52)' })}>Swing</h1>
...
```
You can set the following parameters:
| Property name | CSS property | Default value |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| duration      | animation-duration | 0.15s |
| easing        | animation-timing-function | ease-in-out |
| delay					| animation-delay | (see below) |
| direction     | animation-direction | normal |
| fillMode			| animation-fill-mode | both |

The default value for `delay` is 0 for the out-animation of the old image. If not specified, the `delay` for the in-animation of the new image uses the `duration` value.  The in-animation therefore begins as soon as the out-animation is complete. If you explicitly set a value for the delay, this value is used for both the in and out animation. This is typically not what you want. If you want to use different values for the in and out animation, use the `customSwing` function as described in the next section.

###  Extended parametrized usage

If you want to use more than the 5 properties supported by `swing()` or want to have more control over the animations keyframes, you can use the `customSwing()` function. This function takes a name for the transition and an object with the following optional properties:
* `keyframes`: An object with parameters for the keyframes for the animation.
* `base`: An object with the same properties as the `swing()` function.
* `extensions`: An object with arbitrary CSS properties to be used in the forwards/backwards old/new animation.

The function returns a scope identifier to be used with the `data-astro-transition-scope` attribute of the HTML element you want to animate. Under the hood, `customSwing()` generates a style sheet with keyframe information and the defined CSS properties. You  need to add these extended styles to your page by using the [`<AnimationStyle/>`](../AnimationStyle/) component. **Note:** Only use `<AnimationStyle/>` in conjunction with `customSwing()`, not with `swing()`.

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
---
import { customSwing } from "astro-vtbot/animations/swing";

const swingScope = customSwing('mySwing', {
	keyframes: { axis: { y: 1 }, angle: { leave: '90deg', shrink: '-90deg' } },
	base: { duration: '300ms' },
	extensions: {
		forwards: {
			old: { 'transform-origin': 'center left' },
			new: { 'transform-origin': 'center right', 'animation-delay': '0.075s' },
		},
		backwards: {
			old: { 'transform-origin': 'center right' },
			new: { 'transform-origin': 'center left', 'animation-delay': '0.075s' },
		},
	},
});
---
...
<AnimationStyle name="mySwing"/>
<h1 data-astro-transition-scope={swingScope}>Swing</h1>
...
```
#### Keyframes

The keyframes object of the `customSwing()` function has the following properties:

```typescript
type SwingKeyframeParameter = {
	axis?: { x?: number; y?: number; z?: number; };
	angle?: { leave?: string; enter?: string; };
	opacity?: { mid?: number; to?: number; };
};
```
The default values are all 0 with the exception of 
* `opacity.mid = 1`, 
* `angle.leave = "90deg"` and 
* `angle.enter = "-90deg"`. 

<details>
<summary>The values are used as parameters in the following keyframe style sheet</summary>
```
		@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}FwdSwingOut {
		from {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, 0);
			opacity: 1;
		}
		50% {
			opacity: ${midOpacity};
		}
		to {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, ${leaveAngle});
			opacity: ${toOpacity};
		}
	}
	@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}FwdSwingIn {
		from {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, ${enterAngle});
			opacity: ${toOpacity};
		}
		50% {
			opacity: ${midOpacity};
		}
		to {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, 0);
			opacity: 1;
		}
	}
	@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}BwdSwingOut {
		from {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, 0);
			opacity: 1;
		}
		50% {
			opacity: ${midOpacity};
		}
		to {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, ${enterAngle});
			opacity: ${toOpacity};
		}
	}
	@keyframes ${keyframeNamePrefix}BwdSwingIn {
		from {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, ${leaveAngle});
			opacity: ${toOpacity};
		}
		50% {
			opacity: ${midOpacity};
		}
		to {
			transform: rotate3d(${x}, ${y}, ${z}, 0);
			opacity: 1;
		}
	}
```
</details>

#### Base

The value of the `base` property is used to call the `swing()` function as defined above.

#### Extensions

With the `extensions` property you can define all those CSS properties that can not be defined by `swing()` directly. You can specify different values for `forwards` and `backwards`, `in` and `out` animations. These values are merged with the result of calling`swing()` with base parameters and overwrite its properties.
